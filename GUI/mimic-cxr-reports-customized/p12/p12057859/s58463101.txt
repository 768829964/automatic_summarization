 intermittently in the right lower lobe since ___ that. It is more
 pronounced today. It could be pneumonia or combination of atelectasis and
 dependent edema. Left lower lobe is densely consolidated, more so today than
 on ___ but unchanged since ___. Whether this is entirely
 atelectasis or may ___ pneumonia is radiographically indeterminate. Small
 to moderate bilateral pleural effusions are presumed. There is no
 pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube is slightly rotated and all the midline.
