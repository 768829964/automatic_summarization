                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with weakness  // eval infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 When compared to previous exam, there has been no significant interval change.
 Tracheostomy tube is again seen. Bibasilar opacities are suggestive of
 bilateral effusions, larger on the left than on the right.  Prior left PICC is
 no longer visualized.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is difficult to assess
 given bibasilar opacities. Dense atherosclerotic calcification noted in the
 tortuous thoracic aorta. PEG tube identified over the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change of bilateral pleural effusions. These limit
 evaluation for underlying parenchymal opacity/possibility of infection.
