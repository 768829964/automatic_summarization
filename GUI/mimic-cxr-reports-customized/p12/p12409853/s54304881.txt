                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with hemorrhagic stroke, now with concern for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two frontal images of the chest demonstrate well-expanded lungs. 
 There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle due to some pleural
 thickening and likely small pleural effusion.  Chest radiograph is otherwise
 essentially unchanged from prior imaging.  There is some slight atelectasis at
 the right base.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Persistent
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is again seen.  There is mild cardiomegaly
 which is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small left pleural effusion, otherwise unchanged chest
 radiograph.
