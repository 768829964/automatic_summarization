                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with tachypnea and inability to protect against
 secretions, recently extubated, now reintubated  // evaluate ETT position    
 evaluate ETT position
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at 09:05
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 02:46 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal SVC. A
 dual-lumen right internal jugular central line is again seen with its tip in
 the mid SVC.  An endotracheal tube is identified with its tip approximately 7
 cm above the carina.  A right-sided PICC line is seen with its tip overlying
 the mid axilla.
 
 The heart remains enlarged which may reflect cardiomegaly or a pericardial
 effusion. There is an increasing layering left effusion and a smaller right
 effusion. The pulmonary edema may have slightly improved but remains.  The
 retrocardiac area is under penetrated and cannot be well evaluated but there
 is likely at least partial lower lobe atelectasis given the size of the left
 effusion.  No large pneumothorax.
