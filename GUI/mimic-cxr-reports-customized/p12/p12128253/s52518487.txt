                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  MSSA bacteremia, fungemia, intubated, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Rotated positioning.  An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 3.3
 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present -- it extends to the inferior edge
 of this film, but based on positioning, cannot be confirmed to extend beneath
 the diaphragm.  A right IJ central line is present, tip over mid SVC.  A left
 subclavian line is present, tip over proximal/mid SVC.  
 
 The patient is rotated on all images and no image includes both the lung
 apices and costophrenic angle.  Allowing for this, there is cardiomegaly
 similar to ___ at 3:34 p.m.  There is upper zone re-distribution, vascular
 plethora, and interstitial edema, consistent with CHF.  There is diffuse
 opacification in the right and left lungs, suggestive of layering pleural
 effusions.  Increased retrocardiac density is consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.  There is likely also an element of
 consolidation at the right base.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Limited exam, but with cardiomegaly, CHF and probable bilateral effusions,
 with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Overall, the appearance is
 similar to ___.
