 HISTORY:  Sudden desaturation, to assess for mucus plugging.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little
 overall change.  Relatively low lung volumes probably account for some of the
 prominence of the transverse diameter of the heart.  There is asymmetry of
 pulmonary vascularity, more prominent on the left, which could represent some
 degree of pulmonary vascular congestion.  Monitoring and support devices are
 essentially unchanged.
