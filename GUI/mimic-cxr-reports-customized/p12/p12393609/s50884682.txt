                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Low-grade temperature with increasing secretions and
 saturation.  Assess for collapse and/or effusion.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Bibasilar opacities have improved, consistent with improving atelectasis. 
 There is no evidence of collapse.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 Small right pleural effusion is stable.  If any, there is a small left pleural
 effusion.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.
