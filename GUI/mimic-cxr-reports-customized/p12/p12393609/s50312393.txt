                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke with craniotomy and possible VAP.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in satisfactory position.  Little change in the appearance of
 the heart and lungs with some residual opacification at the right base that is
 decreasing.  Left hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen, consistent with
 atelectatic change in the left lower lobe.
 
 Indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.
