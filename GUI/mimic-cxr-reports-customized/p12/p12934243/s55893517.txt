 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable pulmonary edema.  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase
 in extent of the pre-existing pleural effusions.  On the other hand, the signs
 indicative of pulmonary edema have slightly decreased.  There is subsequent
 atelectasis at both lung bases, left more than right.  In the ventilated lung
 portions, there is no evidence of pneumonia.
