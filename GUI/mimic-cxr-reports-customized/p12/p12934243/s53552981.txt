                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old with aspiration pneumonia, evaluate for interval change.
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___.  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable view of the chest shows little overall change to bilateral pleural
 effusions with the right tracking laterally.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is grossly stable.  Endotracheal tube, feeding tube, and right PICC are
 unchanged in position.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No significant interval change.  In view of extensive changes in the lungs, a
 superimposed pneumonia would be difficult to exclude.
