                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Interval progression of pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 Rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, an ET tube is present, tip
 approximately 3.6 cm above carina.  An orogastric-type tube is present, tip
 extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  Right-sided PICC line is present, tip
 over mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 There is probable background hyperinflation, consistent with COPD.  There is
 moderate cardiomegaly.  There is a small-to-moderate left effusion with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Apparent loculated effusion on the
 right.  Patchy increased opacity is seen throughout both lungs, similar to the
 prior study.  Prominence of the hila with a tapered appearance could be
 consistent with pulmonary hypertension.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite change compared to one day earlier.
