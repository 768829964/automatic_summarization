                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status, poor p.o. intake.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The
 costophrenic angles on the frontal view are obscured, presumably from
 overlying soft tissue and possibly other external artifact.  Given this, the
 lungs appear hyperinflated.  No definite focal consolidation is seen.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Prominence of the right
 paratracheal stripe is again seen, which on the prior study was noted to be
 compatible with tortuosity of vessels seen on CT.  Right pleural
 scarring/thickening is again seen.  No overt pulmonary edema is seen.  The
 bones are diffusely osteopenic.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Costophrenic angles obscured on the frontal view, presumably due
 to overlying soft tissue and possibly other external artifact.  Given this,
 the lungs remain hyperinflated without definite acute cardiopulmonary process.
