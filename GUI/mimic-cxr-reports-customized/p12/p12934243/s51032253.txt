                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:19 P.M., ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with recurrent aspiration and tachypnea.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 There has been a substantial improvement in the extent of consolidation in the
 right lung compared to just a week ago, although a large region is still
 affected in the mid lung.  Small to moderate right pleural effusion is smaller
 today than on ___, moderate left pleural effusion is stable, and there
 has probably been some remission in previous mild interstitial edema.  Left
 lower lobe remains densely consolidated, presumably collapsed.  Right PIC line
 is traceable to the mid SVC, but the tip is indistinct.  Heart is at least
 moderately enlarged with a configuration suggesting substantial left atrial
 dilatation.
