                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage, status post clipping.  Evaluate for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal portable radiograph of the chest demonstrates the
 endotracheal tube tip approximately 8.5 cm from the carina.  This should be
 advanced by roughly ___ to 20 mm for more appropriate positioning.  The right
 internal jugular central venous line tip is at the mid portion of the SVC. 
 The enteric tube tip is past the diaphragm and out of the field of view.  As
 compared to the prior study, there is improvement in the pulmonary edema and
 right pleural effusion.  Concurrent pneumonia is a possibility.  The
 cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Malpositioned endotracheal tube, should be advanced by roughly 2 cm for
 more appropriate positioning.
 2.  Interval improvement in pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion.
 
 These findings were relayed to the ___ nurse taking care of the patient, by
 Dr. ___, at 10:12 a.m. on ___.
