  ET Tube repositioned now lies satisfactorily with trachea.  Nasogastric and
  internal jugular catheters are unchanged in satisfactory position.  Overlying
  cooling blanket limits assessment with the appearance of intervally increased
  vascular congestion and perhaps mild edema.  More confluent left basal opacity
  could reflect atelectasis, though aspiration or pneumonia, however is most
  likely to reflect effects of recent bronchoscopy and small volume lavage (per
  discussion with Dr. ___ by Dr ___ by phone at ___)

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Interval change, evaluation of endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has
 been advanced.  The tip of the tube now projects 4 cm above the carina and is
 in correct location.  The course of the nasogastric tube and the position of
 the right internal jugular vein catheter is constant.  Increasing left lower
 lobe atelectasis.  Mild fluid overload.  No evidence of pneumonia.  Unchanged
 mild cardiomegaly.
