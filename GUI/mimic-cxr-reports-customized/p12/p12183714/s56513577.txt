 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intubation, ARDS.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  This includes the unchanged position of the chest
 tubes.  The endotracheal tube should be advanced by approximately 3-4 cm as it
 is located very high up in the trachea.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax
 and pleural effusions.  Mild atelectasis, notably in the right medial lung
 base persists.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.
