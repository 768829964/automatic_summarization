                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachypnea and pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 A tracheostomy tube is in place.  A left subclavian PICC line is present, tip
 at distal SVC/RA junction.  
 
 There is patchy opacity at the right lung base, most pronounced in the
 cardiophrenic region, but extending into the prrihilar and immediate
 suprahilar area.  Compared with ___, this is slightly improved.  Small
 right effusion appears to have resolved.  There has been essentially complete
 clearing of the previously seen small patchy opacity at the left base.  Lungs
 are better expanded and there is no evidence of CHF.  The upper and mid zones
 are otherwise grossly clear. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Residual patchy opacity in the right perihilar and cardiophrenic regions,
 but with interval improvement.
 
 1) Complete resolution of left base opacity.
