                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post bronchoscopy and tumor treatment on the
 left side.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray and chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  Opacity projecting over the lingula likely reflects components of
 post-obstructive pneumonia as well as edema/hemorrhage from recent procedure. 
 This opacity obscures the left heart border, but the heart size is likely
 normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  No pneumomediastinum is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.
 2.  Lingular opacity reflects post-obstructive pneumonia and/or post-treatment
 changes.
