                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx lung cancer s/p stent with ?post
 obstructive PNA  // iinterval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ and CT chest dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 
 Tracheostomy tube is in the midline, unchanged from prior.  The right PICC
 line has been repositioned, looping in the internal jugular vein and
 terminating in the right brachiocephalic vein.
 
 Diffuse opacification in the right hemithorax is unchanged.  The left mid lung
 opacity obscuring the left heart border is more prominent.  This is partially
 due to the lung lesion seen on recent CT, but postobstructive pneumonia cannot
 be ruled out. Small pleural effusion on the right is unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval increase of the left mid lung opacification partially due to
 underlying lung lesion but postobstructive pneumonia cannot be ruled out.
 
 2.  Interval reposition of right PICC line looping in the right internal
 jugular vein and terminating in the right brachiocephalic vein
