                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is apparently status post previous partial right lung
 resection.  Superimposed on chronic pleural and parenchymal scarring is a new
 heterogeneous opacity at the right lung base.  Within the left lung, a new
 patchy and linear area of opacification is present in the lingula with partial
 obscuration of the left heart border.  Overall heart size is normal. 
 Tortuosity of the thoracic aorta is unchanged.  No evidence of pleural
 effusion or acute skeletal finding.  Finally, note is made of upper lobe
 predominant emphysema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New heterogeneous right lower lung opacity, which may represent
 an acute pneumonia superimposed upon chronic scarring.  Additional opacity in
 the lingula may reflect either a second focus of pneumonia or a focal
 atelectasis.  Considering history of lung cancer, followup chest x-ray is
 recommended in four to six weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy in
 order to ensure complete resolution.
