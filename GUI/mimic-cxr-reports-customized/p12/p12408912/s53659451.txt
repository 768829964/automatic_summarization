                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute shortness of breath.  History of COPD.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is normal in size.  The heart is moderately tortuous. The lingula
 appears collapsed with a triangular shape.  Vague opacities are probably for
 the most part subpleural about the lower right hemithorax with streaky
 character, possibly due to chronic scarring or atelectasis, which seems more
 likely to explain the finding than acute infection.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggest collapse of the lingula.  Short-term follow-up radiographs
 are recommended to reassess in addition to comparison to prior radiographs, if
 available from elsewhere.  In addition to sequela of mucus plugging or
 infection, subtle obstructing masse is not excluded by this examination.
