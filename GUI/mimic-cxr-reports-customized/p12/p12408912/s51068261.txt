                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of lung cancer, shortness of breath, and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest on ___ and chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is a new lingular
 consolidation that has increased in size compared to ___.  The
 previously seen streaky opacities in the right lower lobe are stable to
 slightly decreased, some of which likely represent scarring.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The right mediastinal border is thickened compared
 to prior study, this may indicate lymphadenopathy or differences in technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New lingular consolidation.  This may represent pneumonia;
 however, in the setting of lung cancer, findings could be due to
 post-obstructive pneumonia or less likely lymphangitic spread.
