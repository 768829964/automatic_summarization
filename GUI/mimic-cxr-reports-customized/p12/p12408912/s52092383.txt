                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, fever, tachypnea.  History of lobectomy for
 lung cancer.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours
 are unremarkable.  There is increased lucency of the right hemithorax with
 right upper lung chain sutures, consistent with history of lobectomy.  There
 is bibasilar atelectasis with slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. 
 Hazy left upper lung opacity is new since the prior exam. Previously seen left
 lower lung opacity has improved.  Indistinct and blunted appearance of the
 right costophrenic angles may represent a small pleural effusion, though this
 may in part be explained by motion artifact.  No pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1  New left upper lung hazy opacity, consistent with infection.  This could be
 further evaluated with conventional frontal and lateral radiographs if
 clinically indicated.
 2. Interval improvement in previously seen left lower lung opacity.
 3. Increased chronic blunting of right costophrenic angle may be due to motion
 or a small pleural effusion.
