 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral parenchymal or opacities are noted.  Most dense consolidation is
 identified at the left lung base, which has progressed since prior with
 silhouetting of the hemidiaphragm.  Chronic distortion of the parenchyma
 markings seen at the right lung base.  Cardiac silhouette is grossly
 unchanged.  No acute osseous abnormalities.

 to known underlying mass with likely component of postobstructive atelectasis
 and/or infection.
