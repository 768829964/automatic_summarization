                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient requiring evaluation for PA catheter
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP view of the chest.
 
 IMPRESSION:  An endotracheal tube is no less than 7 cm from the carina. The
 Swan-Ganz catheter tip is seen in the proximal right pulmonary artery. A
 pleural drain is seen coursing through the left lung and there are multpile
 mediastinal drains. An enteric tube is terminating within the stomach.
 Sternotomy wires are intact. 
 
 There is a uniform hazy opacity seen in the right mid lobe down to the base of
 the lung, which does not obscure the diaphragmatic contour and is likely a
 pleural effusion. A dense streak is again seen in the region of the normal
 position of the minor fissure. There is  opacification of the left lung base
 consistent with atelectasis and/or effusion.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube no less than 7 cm from the carina, for which advancing
 2-3 cm is recommended for a more secure seating. 
 
 2.  Swan Ganz catheter tip at right pulmonary artery.
 
 3.  Right-sided pleural effusion.
