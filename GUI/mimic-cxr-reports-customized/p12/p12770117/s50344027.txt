                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man having high peak pressures on vent  // ?interval
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:30 p.m. and ___
 at 03:52 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 No definite interval radiographic change. Inspiratory volumes are low, similar
 to the prior study.
 
 Again seen are extensive opacities throughout both lungs. More confluent
 opacity at the right lung apex is again noted, similar to the prior study. 
 There could be very slight interval improvement in the left mid-zone, but any
 differences quite minimal.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is obscured by the parenchymal findings, but
 not clearly changed.
 
 Again noted is a tracheostomy tube, right IJ line with tip over proximal/mid
 SVC and a left-sided PICC line, with tip over mid SVC.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive opacities in both lungs again noted.  Possible minimal increased
 aeration in the left mid zone, but the overall pattern is quite similar to the
 2 most recent films (both from ___).
