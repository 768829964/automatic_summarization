                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p VATS RUL lobectomy, new chest wall crepitus
 on exam  // Please eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since the recent study of 1 day earlier with the exception of a tiny lateral
 right pneumothorax is newly appreciated, with indwelling chest tube in place,
 and slight increase in amount of subcutaneous emphysema and right chest wall. 
 Right juxta hilar opacification has also slightly increased in this patient
 was status post recent right upper lobe resection.  This may reflect worsening
 postoperative atelectasis, and less likely other postoperative complications
 such has torsion.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for worsening left basilar
 atelectasis.
