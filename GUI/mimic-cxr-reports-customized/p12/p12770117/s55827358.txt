                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with  ARDS vs. pneumonia, please assess
 evolution. also spiked temp.  // please assess PNA, fluid overload, ARDS.    
 please assess PNA, fluid overload, ARDS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 15:26
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable chest radiograph ___ at 06:15 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The endotracheal tube has its tip 2.7 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube
 is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  There is a
 worsening bilateral airspace process but more focally in the right medial
 lung.  Although this may reflect worsening edema, a worsening infectious
 process or possibly right middle lobe collapse should be considered.  Clinical
 correlation is recommended.  No large pneumothorax is appreciated, although
 the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences
 in positioning.
