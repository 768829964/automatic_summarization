                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p fall, found down unknown duration, found to have small
 foci IPH, nondisplaced sternal manubrial ___, mediastinal hematoma, L4 burst
 fracture with retropulsion and obliteration of the spinal canal, T11/L2
 compression fracture, T10 left superior facet, T11 inf facet fracture, R fem
 neck ___, R proximal femur ___, ___ R PTX s/p Lasix ___, R pigtail removal and
 now fever 102.6.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the earlier chest radiograph, there has been interval removal of
 the right-sided pigtail catheter.  No change in the right IJ central line. 
 The endotracheal tube projects 3.1 cm above the carina.  Multifocal opacities
 have improved since the prior study.  There are likely small bilateral
 effusions.  Incidental note is made of lumbar spinal fusion hardware and an
 IVC filter.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improvement of multifocal opacities suggests the underlying process could be
 due to aspiration.
