                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 05:32
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.5 cm above the level of the
 carina.  Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm terminating expected
 location of the distal stomach.  A right-sided subclavian catheter is stable
 in position.  There are low lung volumes.  Multifocal right-sided pulmonary
 opacities have increased in the interval which may be due underlying
 aspiration and/ or worsening multifocal pneumonia.  Left mid to lower lung
 opacities are grossly stable to possibly very slightly increased.  No large
 pleural effusion is seen although trace pleural effusions are difficult to
 exclude.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in multifocal pulmonary opacities, particularly on the
 right, could be due to aspiration and/ or worsening multifocal pneumonia.
