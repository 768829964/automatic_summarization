                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with sob  // eval for chf or pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Stable mild to moderate cardiomegaly.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are also stable.  Extensive interstitial abnormality, with basal predominance
 is most likely moderate to severe pulmonary edema, and could obscure a
 predisposing interstitial pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  There is a small right
 pleural effusion and likely trace left pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic mild to moderate cardiomegaly. Recurrent, moderately severe pulmonary
 edema. Suggest radiographic followup treatment of heart failure, to detect any
 concurrent pneumonia.
 
 Incidental note is made of large cervical ribs, sometimes a cause of
 neurovascular impingement.
