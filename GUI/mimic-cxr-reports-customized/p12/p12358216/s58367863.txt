                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with right-sided pleural effusion,
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  The right-sided basal density has improved and the
 right-sided diaphragmatic contour is now visible again indicating marked
 reduction of the previously identified right-sided basal pleural effusion.  It
 is assumed that a right-sided thoracocentesis has been performed during the
 latest examination interval.  The lung remains well aerated and there is no
 evidence of significant pneumothorax in the right apical area.  Basal right
 sided density persists, raising suspicion of pulmonary parenchymal process in
 this area.  In the left hemithorax, no evidence of new acute parenchymal
 infiltrates.
