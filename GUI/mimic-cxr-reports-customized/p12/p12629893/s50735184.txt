                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Numerous prior chest radiographs, the most recent ___.  CT
 chest, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright frontal radiograph of the chest reveals
 increased interstitial markings bilaterally and persistent hazy opacity at the
 periphery of the right upper lobe abutting the minor fissure, possibly
 representing mild interstitial pulmonary edema superimposed on a background of
 chronic interstitial abnormality and emphysematous changes.  No new focal
 airspace opacity is appreciated.  The right costophrenic sulcus is not
 included on this image.  The heart size is slightly enlarged, stable.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are normal.  There is no large pleural effusion
 or pneumothorax detected. Median sternotomy wires are in place. 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Increased interstitial markings suggesting mild pulmonary edema
 superimposed on a background of chronic interstitial abnormality and
 emphysematous change.
 2. Stable mild cardiomegaly.
