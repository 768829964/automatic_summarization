                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of myocardial infarction and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Patient is status post median sternotomy
 and CABG.  The lungs are hyperinflated, compatible with patient's known
 history of emphysema.  The heart size is top normal.  There are ill-defined
 bilateral diffuse interstitial opacities compatible with mild-to-moderate
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions
 increased in size when compared to the prior study.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  More focal bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis but
 infection cannot be completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema with small
 bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar airspace opacities, likely
 atelectasis.
