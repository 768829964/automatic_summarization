                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 6:03 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post right upper lobe resection and
 SVC reconstruction with difficulty clearing secretions, question etiology for
 acute dyspnea.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portable erect chest film ___ at 6:04 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There is complete opacification of the right hemithorax with no residual
 aerated lung and stable post-operative changes.  Mucous plugging should be
 considered. A small amount of loculated air is seen at the right apex.  There
 continues to be a diffuse interstitial abnormality within the left lung with a
 slightly more consolidative appearance at the left base, which could reflect a
 superimposed infectious process, atelectatsis, or worsening edema.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  There has been prior median sternotomy.  Assessment
 of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult due to the complete
 opacification of the right hemithorax.
