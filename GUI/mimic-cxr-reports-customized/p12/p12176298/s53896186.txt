                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post right upper lobe resection
 for squamous cell carcinoma, status post extubation, now with whiteout of
 right side.  Status post bronchoscopy, evaluate post-bronchoscopic aeration of
 right lung.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study obtained seven hours earlier during the same day.  Again, the patient is
 presently extubated.  Previously described sternotomy wires, surgical clips
 following lobectomy appear unchanged.  Apparently bronchoscopic efforts have
 been made to improve aeration of the right-sided lung.  There is a mild
 improvement with increased aeration in the central portion of the right
 hemithorax.  The degree of aeration of the remaining right lower lobe,
 however, is still not completely restored.  No other significant interval
 changes can be identified.
