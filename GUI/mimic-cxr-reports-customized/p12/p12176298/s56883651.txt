                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress, right lower lobe consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:46 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing opacity
 with air-fluid levels, partly pleural and partly parenchymal, has increased in
 extent and severity.  The mediastinal shift towards the right is more
 extensive than before, suggesting increasing volume loss on the right.
 
 On the left, the image is unchanged.  No evidence of acute left lung disease.
