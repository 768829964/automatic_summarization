                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Right lower lobe collapse, on vent.  Assess for acute
 intrathoracic process.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided.  Tracheostomy
 tube is partially imaged.  Midline sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are
 noted. There is a large right pleural effusion surrounding a portion of
 aerated lung which contains patchy airspace consolidation concerning for edema
 or pneumonia.  There is also a left effusion with scattered left perihilar
 opacity which could represent pulmonary edema.  PEG tube projects over the
 left upper quadrant.  No gross bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Large right and smaller left pleural effusion with probable
 pulmonary edema accounting for the opacities seen in the lungs bilaterally.
