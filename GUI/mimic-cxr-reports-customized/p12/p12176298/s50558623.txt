 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Bilateral opacities, status post right upper lobectomy,
 evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Pre-existing extensive right basal opacities and right apical
 consolidations are unchanged in extent and severity.  Unchanged appearance of
 the left lung, with predominantly perihilar and basal interstitial prominence,
 suggesting the presence of mild fluid overload.  Unchanged appearance of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged position of the tracheostomy tube.
