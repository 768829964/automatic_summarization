  Low lung volumes. ET tube is in the upper trachea at approximately 6.0 cm from
  the carina. Right IJ and right picc appear relatively stable with perhaps
  minimal distal progression of the right IJ tip to the cavo-atrial junction.
  Enteric tube tip terminates below the diaphragm.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with ET tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 8 cm above the carina.  The NG tube passes below the
 diaphragm terminating in the stomach.  Right internal jugular line tip is at
 the cavoatrial junction/proximal right atrium.  The right PICC line tip is at
 the level of mid SVC.  Bilateral pleural effusions are redemonstrated as well
 as minimal bibasal atelectasis.  Overall, no substantial change since the
 prior study has been demonstrated.
