                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with rib fractures, bacteremia, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ - ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates an NG tube, and
 right upper extremity PICC in standard position.  The ETT is at the level of
 the clavicular heads on this kyphotic film. 
 
 Bilateral moderate pleural effusions appear increased.  Bibasilar atelectasis
 appears similar.  Top normal cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Mild pulmonary edema is little changed. Rib fractures are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The ETT projects of the level of the clavicular heads, and a repeat film
 with better positioning would be helpful to assess the true ETT position of
 clinically indicated.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes, with unchanged pulmonary edema and increasing moderate
 bilateral pleural effusions.
