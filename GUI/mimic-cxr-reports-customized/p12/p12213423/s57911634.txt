 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:10 PM
  The support devices are in similar position. The left subclavian central
  venous line does not cross midline and likely terminates within the
  brachiocephalic vein. There is no significant change in the lungs with low
  lung volumes persisting. Continued mild edema and possible right basilar
  opacity.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis, transferred status post ex lap for possible rectal
 perforation, known PE, compare to prior.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ and 22:14 p.m.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 5.3 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm off the film.  The exact
 position of the diaphragm is difficult to assess here.  There are overlying
 skin ___.  Left subclavian central line is present.  The tip, as before,
 does not cross the midline and may lie near the confluence of the left IJ and
 subclavian veins, or immediately distal to it.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes.  As before, the mediastinum appears
 enlarged. Splaying of the carina is again noted. There is increased opacity at
 both lung apices, greater on the right.  There is vascular plethora and some
 focal areas of more confluent opacity in the right lung.  There is obscuration
 of the right hemidiaphragm, likely reflecting a layering effusion, probably
 with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  There is partial obscuration
 of the left retrocardiac/hemidiaphragm, which has progressed.  No gross left
 effusion.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes as described, similar to the prior film.
 2.  Enlarged mediastinum, of uncertain etiology, unchanged compared with
 ___.
 3.  CHF with vascular plethora and interstitial edema.
 4.  Layering right effusion.
 5.  Bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation.  The right effusion and bibasilar
 collapse and/or consolidation are worse compared with ___.  
 6.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are again enlarged and poorly
 characterized on these films.  There is evidence for left atrial enlargement. 
 If clinically indicated, CT could help to better assess the etiology of the
 cardiomediastinal prominence.
