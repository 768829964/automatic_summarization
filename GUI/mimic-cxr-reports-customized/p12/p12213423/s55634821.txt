                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p ex-lap for bowel perforation ___, intubated and septic
 since then, now with right pleural effusion and consolidation, s/p repeat
 bronch this morning. O2 and ventilatory requirements have been increasing in
 the last few hours.  // Interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal improvement in
 ventilation of the right than left lung base.  The lung volumes, however,
 remain low and bilateral small pleural effusions are visualized. Moderate
 cardiomegaly persists.  The monitoring and support devices are constant. 
 However, given the different projection, a loop of the esophageal device is
 now visualized at the upper aspect 's of the image.  The loop could represent
 a coiling in the pharynx and should be assessed clinically.
