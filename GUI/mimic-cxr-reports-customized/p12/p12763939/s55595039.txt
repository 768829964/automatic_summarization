                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Motor vehicle accident, tracheostomy placed.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 CHEST 
 
 There is increased density overlying the left lower lobe; this I believe is
 due to overlying soft tissues and the underlying lung is clear.
 
 The position of the subclavian line is unchanged.  The tip of the nasogastric
 tube lies within the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lungs clear.
