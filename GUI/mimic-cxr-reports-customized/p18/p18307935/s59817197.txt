                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Permanent pacemaker remains in place in the left anterior chest
 wall, with a similar imaging appearance of pacing electrodes including
 extrapericardial patches.  Allowing for differences in technique and
 projection, the appearance of the device is unchanged since ___. 
 A right PICC remains in place, terminating in the lower superior vena cava. 
 Heart size remains normal, and there is stable tortuosity or mild dilation of
 the ascending aorta.  Lungs are clear except for linear scarring at the left
 base adjacent to a mildly elevated left hemidiaphragm.  Minimal lateral
 blunting of left costophrenic sulcus favors pleural thickening over small
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable radiographic appearance of the chest with no findings to
 account for pacemaker site pain.
