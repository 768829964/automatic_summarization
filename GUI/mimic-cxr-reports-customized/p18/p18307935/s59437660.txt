                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever, tachycardia, and concern for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiographs from ___
 and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal image of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which are likely secondary to poor inspiration.  There has been interval
 increase in the left lower lobe opacity.  The increase in opacity of the right
 perihilar region likely represents vascular crowding secondary to low lung
 volumes.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is slightly more obscured by the
 increasing left opacity but appears to be unchanged from prior exam.  The
 right central line, defibrillator devices, and NG tube appear to be in
 unchanged positions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing left lower lobe opacity.
