 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Low-grade temperature, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  There is subsequent increase in density of the lung parenchyma. 
 Unchanged is the course of the right venous access line and position of the
 defibrillator devices.  Also unchanged is the appearance of a mild scar in the
 left lung.  There is continued elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  Neither
 the frontal nor the lateral radiographs show evidence of focal parenchymal
 opacities suggesting pneumonia.  Unchanged normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
