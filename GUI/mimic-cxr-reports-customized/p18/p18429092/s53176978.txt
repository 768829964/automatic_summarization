 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with shortness of breath, dx of PNA at OSH  //
 please evaluate for consolidation, volume overload      please evaluate for
 consolidation, volume overload
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild edema has cleared from the upper lungs.  It is difficult to say whether
 residual opacification in the lower lobes, particular the right is just
 atelectasis and dependent edema or whether there is also consolidation.  Mild
 cardiac enlargement and small pleural effusions are unchanged, but both are
 probably exaggerated by extensive fat deposition.  No pneumothorax.
