                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with question of tracheostomy balloon deflation,
 difficulty breathing
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph, ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube tip is in unchanged position.  Right PICC tip terminates in
 the mid SVC.  Cardiac silhouette size remains moderate to severely enlarged. 
 Mediastinal contour remains widened, and this is due to underlying mediastinal
 lipomatosis as seen on the prior CT.  Moderate pulmonary edema appears worse
 compared to the previous exam with layering bilateral pleural effusions again
 noted.  More focal opacities in the lung bases likely reflect areas of
 atelectasis though infection is not excluded.  No large pneumothorax is
 identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Worsening moderate pulmonary edema with continued layering bilateral
 pleural effusions.  Increased bibasilar opacities likely reflect worsening
 atelectasis though infection is not excluded.
 2. Tracheostomy tube tip in unchanged position.
