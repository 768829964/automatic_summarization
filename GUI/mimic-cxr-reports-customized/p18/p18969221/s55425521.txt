                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE CHEST
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with POD 6 asc aorta replacement // verify
 dobhoff for tube feeds
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Monitoring and support devices including ET tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, left
 internal jugular central venous catheter, and partially visualized enteric
 tube are in stable position.  The distal end of the Dobbhoff tube is not
 included in view.
 
 Patient positioning limits the evaluation. However, lung volumes remain low. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are not appreciably changed. Left retrocardiac
 opacity is re- demonstrated. There is no large pneumothorax. Tortuosity of the
 aortic arch is exaggerated by scoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The Dobbhoff tube courses into the stomach however its distal end is not
 included in view and its position cannot be confirmed. If clinically indicated
 the study can be repeated.
