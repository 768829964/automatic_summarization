                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with as above  // s/p reop for tamponade r/o
 PTX-check line and tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Plain film
 
 COMPARISON:  Same date at 11:04
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube appears low, less than 2 cm above the carina.
 New since the earlier study are bilateral thoracic catheters as well as 2
 mediastinal chest tubes projected over the heart.  Small medial apical
 pneumothorax is suggested but not definite. Double density over the upper left
 cardiac border corresponds to known hematoma. Feeding tube has been removed.
 The nasogastric tube remains in place with the tip and side hole both below
 the left hemidiaphragm.  The left hemidiaphragm remains obscured.  Vague
 opacity in the right mid lung field represents fluid in the fissure.  Marked
 thoracic dextroscoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Note made of new thoracic catheters and mediastinal drains mediastinal
 hematoma and possible small left medial apical pneumothorax. Note low position
 of endotracheal tube.
