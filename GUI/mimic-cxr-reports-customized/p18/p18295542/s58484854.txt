 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:30 PM
  Bilateral opacities are noted, greatest at the left apex, and likely
  representative of a combination of pulmonary vascular markings and
  atelectasis. However, an early pneumonia may have a similar picture in the
  proper clinical setting and continued followup with radiographs is
  recommended. Small left pleural effusion.
 WET READ VERSION #___ ___ ___ 9:27 PM
  Small left pleural effusion with mild bilateral atelectasis and mildly
  increased central venous pressures.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Respiratory failure, new tracheostomy tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  There is no pneumothorax or large
 pleural effusions.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  There are bibasilar
 atelectases.  Left upper lobe ill-defined peribronchial opacities could be due
 to atelectasis, but aspiration or early pneumonia can have the same radiologic
 appearance and followup is recommended.
 
 Moderate pleural effusion has resolved.
