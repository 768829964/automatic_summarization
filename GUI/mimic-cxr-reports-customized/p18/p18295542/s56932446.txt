                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Trach interval study.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is present, tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  A
 left subclavian central line is present, tip over distal SVC.  No pneumothorax
 is detected.  
 
 Compared with ___ at 20:55 p.m., there is interval obscuration of the
 left hemidiaphragm consistent with a small left effusion.  Probable slight
 worsening of the degree of retrocardiac opacity/left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation. Extensive scattered opacities in both lungs are grossly
 unchanged.  Minimal blunting in the right costophrenic angle could reflect a
 tiny right effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 New opacification of the left hemidiaphragm and blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle, consistent with a new small left effusion and probable
 slight progression of left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
