                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pneumonia, septic shock.  Study
 requested for evaluation of interval change and evaluation of PICC line
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: No peripheral catheter is visualized. Tracheostomy tube is midline
 and appears unchanged in position.  As compared to prior chest radiograph from
 ___, there has been interval increase of a left lower lung opacity,
 likely due to increased pleural effusion and adjacent consolidation. Right
 lung base consolidation is unchanged.  No new parenchymal opacities are
 identified. There is interval increase of mild vascular congestion. There is
 no pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No peripheral catheter is visualized.
 
 2.  Interval increase of left lower lobe opacity, likely due to increased
 effusion and consolidation with unchanged right lower lobe consolidation,
 concerning for pneumonia. 
 
 3. Increased mild vascular congestion.
