 INDICATION:  Pneumonia with trach in place, assess for change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Tracheostomy tube, feeding tube, and left subclavian central venous
 catheter are unchanged in position.  Left upper lobe parenchymal cavitary
 opacities are similar, perhaps slightly decreased from the prior study.  The
 bases are better aerated bilaterally with decrease in retrocardiac
 opacification.  Trace left pleural effusion may be present.  Cardiac size and
 cardiomediastinal silhouette are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Perhaps slight decrease in left upper lobe opacity with trace left
 pleural effusion.
