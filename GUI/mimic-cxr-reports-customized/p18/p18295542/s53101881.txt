                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:14
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumothorax, assess for interval
 change.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 9:10.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 5:14 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 A tracheostomy tube remains in place.  Right subclavian central line has its
 tip in the mid-to-distal SVC unchanged.  Basilar chest tube remains in
 position.  There is a small but stable left apical lateral pneumothorax. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle may represent pleural thickening
 versus a small effusion.  There is also persistent patchy opacity at the left
 base which may reflect atelectasis, although an acute infectious process
 cannot be excluded.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences in patient rotation
 between studies.
