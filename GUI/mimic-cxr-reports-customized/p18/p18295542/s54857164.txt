                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tracheostomy and pneumonia, assess for interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright portable radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cavitated consolidation in the left upper lung is overall
 unchanged.  Right basal bullous changes with more conspicuous thickened walls
 than expected based on recent CT findings. It is uncertain if this is due to
 surrounding fluid or secondary infectious process. Atelectasis and effusion is
 present at the left base. Tracheostomy tube is in appropriate position.  Left
 subclavian line terminates in the proximal SVC.  Enteric tube courses into the
 stomach and out of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Unchanged left upper lung cavitated consolidation. 
 2. Bullous changes in the right lung base with possible surrounding infection.
 3. Unchanged small left pleural effusion.
