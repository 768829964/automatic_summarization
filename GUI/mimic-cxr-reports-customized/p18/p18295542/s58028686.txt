 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with chest tube in place.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tracheostomy is in place.  An endogastric tube courses
 inferiorly out of the field of view.  A left chest tube is in place.  A
 right-sided PICC tip terminates in the mid-to-lower SVC.  Diffuse subcutaneous
 emphysema is seen throughout the visualized soft tissues, limiting assessment
 of fine detail within the lungs.  Within that limitation, there is no apparent
 large pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The lungs demonstrate some mild
 retrocardiac atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lines and tubes in place with diffuse subcutaneous emphysema, but
 no appreciable interval change.
