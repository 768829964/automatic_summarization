 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in

 Perihilar and basilar airspace opacities are again demonstrated, and have
 slightly worsened compared to the prior study.  These findings may represent a
 combination of pulmonary edema and pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Small-to-moderate pleural effusions are again demonstrated
 bilaterally.
