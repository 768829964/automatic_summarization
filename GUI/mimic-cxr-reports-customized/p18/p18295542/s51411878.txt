 PORTABLE CHEST ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position.  Persistent marked cardiomegaly, but decrease in extent of pulmonary
 vascular congestion and improvement in severity of pulmonary edema.  Small to
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions also appear slightly improved, although
 positional differences may contribute to this apparent change.
