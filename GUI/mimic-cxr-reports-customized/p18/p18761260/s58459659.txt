                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with clinical concerning for pneumonia.  For evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 The heart is at the upper limits of normal for size.  Even allowing for
 projection.
 
 There is probably a degree of moderate pulmonary edema with some peribronchial
 cuffing, increased lung markings.  I suspect that some motion unsharpness is
 present here, arguably augmenting these changes.  The patient's ET tube is in
 good position.  Right-sided central line remains in unchanged position. 
 Chronic left basal atelectasis.
 
 Little interval change from prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 No interval change from prior study.  Left basilar atelectasis likely
 effusion.  Moderate pulmonary edema.
