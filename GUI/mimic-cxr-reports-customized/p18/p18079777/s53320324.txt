 FINDINGS: 
 
 Semi upright views of the chest provided.
 
 ET tube tip is in the mid thoracic trachea.  NG tube tip is in the stomach,
 with the side port near the GE junction.  Surgical clips near the GE junction
 are likely related to gastric surgery.
 
 Diffuse hazy opacification of the left lower lobe, lingula, and partially in
 the right middle lobe are similar to prior.  There is no pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to prior. Imaged osseous structures
 are intact.  No free air below the right hemidiaphragm is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube tip is in the mid thoracic trachea.
 2. NG tube tip is in the stomach, with the side port near the GE junction.  If
 tube function is suboptimal, consider advancement.
