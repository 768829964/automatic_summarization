                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever.  Please evaluate for evidence of
 pneumonia or any other infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are well inflated.  Patchy opacity in the right base was
 not clearly seen in prior exam.  The remaining lungs are clear.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Healed fractures of the fifth, sixth, seventh posterior right ribs
 are noted.  Prior tracheostomy tube no longer seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy opacity in the right lung base might represent atelectasis
 versus developing consolidation or aspiration. Clinical correlation is
 advised.
