                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with bleeding from tracheostomy.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia and PICC placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable upright AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates a tracheostomy
 catheter in unchanged position.  The aortic stent graft is unchanged also. 
 The lung volumes are low and there is a stable small left pleural effusion. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and retrocardiac atelectasis is stable.  There is a
 faint linear opacity over the patient's left upper chest, which may represent
 the PICC, but it could be overlapping of underlying structures.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Persistent widening of the mediastinum and cardiac silhouettes.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Stable cardiomegaly, left pleural effusion, and retrocardiac atelectasis.
 
 2. The PICC is malpositioned and cannot be seen well.  A linear density over
 the superior posterior fourth rib, nevertheless, it is out of position.  This
 was confirmed with a discussion with the patient's nurse, ___, by phone on
 ___ at 4:40 pm, who noted that there is a left PICC that appears to be
 pulled out significantly and which they plan to reposition or remove.
 
 3. No interval mediastinal widening.
