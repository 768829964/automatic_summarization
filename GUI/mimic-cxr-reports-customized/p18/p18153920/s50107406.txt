                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation with chest tubes, assess for change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Portable upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Endotracheal tube,
 Dobbhoff tube, right PICC and bilateral apically-directed chest tubes are in
 unchanged position.  Waxing and waning right upper lobe opacification is
 slightly improved on the current examination, likely due to improved aeration
 and decreased pleural effusion.  Retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged with
 decreased now small left pleural effusion.  Right apical pneumothorax is
 unchanged to minimally improved.  Left apical pneumothorax is unchanged. 
 Cardiac size and silhouette are unremarkable. Small amount of left lateral
 chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: Unchanged to slightly improved bilateral apical pneumothoraces
 with chest tubes in position.  Small left pleural effusion.
