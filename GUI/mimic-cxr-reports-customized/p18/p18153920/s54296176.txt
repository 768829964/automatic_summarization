                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated with a poor neurologic exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-erect AP view of the chest was reviewed and compared
 to the prior studies.  An endotracheal tube's tip ends 5-6 cm above the
 carina.  A right-sided chest tube crosses the mid lung obliquely.  A
 right-sided PICC line ends in the upper right atrium.  A Dobbhoff tube ends in
 the upper stomach.  Opacification has increased in the right upper lobe.  Mild
 pulmonary edema is unchanged in the remainder of the lungs.  Minimal right
 apical pneumothorax, pulmonary venous engorgement and a moderate left pleural
 effusion are also unchanged.  Heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Probable, new right upper lobe pneumonia.
 2.  Minimal right apical pneumothorax, mild pulmonary edema and moderate left
 pleural effusion are unchanged.
 4.  Venous engorgement indicates increased intravascular volume.
