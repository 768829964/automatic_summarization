                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with right chest tube removed, history of trauma. 
 Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 5 hours earlier.
 
 Now moderate left pneumothorax has markedly increased in size.  The
 cardiomediastinum is slightly shifted towards the right.  Right chest tube has
 been removed.  Tiny right apical pneumothorax is unchanged.    Right PICC tip
 is at the cavoatrial junction or upper right atrium.  Medial left chest tube
 remains in place in unchanged position.
