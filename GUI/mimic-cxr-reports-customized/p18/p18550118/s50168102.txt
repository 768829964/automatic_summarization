 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post bronchoscopy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slightly
 different distribution of the extensive bilateral pleural effusions with
 accompanying atelectasis.  Additional evidence of left-sided volume loss.  The
 nasogastric tube and the chest tube are in unchanged position.  After
 bronchoscopy there is no evidence of pneumothorax.
