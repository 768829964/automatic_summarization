 coil/embolization, stroke with left sided hemiplegia, seizure disorder with
 recent frequent breakthrough seizures presented to OSH ___ with prolonged
 convulsive seizures, course complicated by acute systolic heart failure, ___,
 ARDS, strenotrophomonas VAP, subsequent seizure on ___, now s/p trach/PEG.

 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes and marked patient rotation limit overall assessment of the
 chest.  With these limitations in mind, it cardiomegaly is apparently stable. 
 New hazy increased opacity is evident in the right infrahilar region, and
 could be due to a developing pneumonia or a focus of aspiration.  Short-term
 followup radiographs with improved positioning may be helpful for more
 complete assessment when the patient's condition permits.
