 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 17:29
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 10:30 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Given differences in technique, there is persistent bilateral airspace opacity
 which likely is not significantly changed but may reflect moderate to severe
 pulmonary edema or a diffuse infectious process.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended.  The heart remains enlarged likely reflecting cardiomegaly,
 although pericardial effusion should also be considered.  No obvious
 pneumothorax.  The left PICC line and right internal jugular central line
 continue to have their tips in the right atrium.
