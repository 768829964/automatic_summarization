                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p cardiac surgery with pna, now s/p drainage of
 effusions  // size of effusions, chest tube position, infiltrate quality
 ___ year old man with new dobhoff tube  // new dobhoff tube position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The initial radiograph of 08:34 shows interval removal of the nasogastric
 tube. Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned. Bilateral pigtail catheters are
 unchanged in position. An endotracheal tube terminates at the level of the
 clavicles. A left IJ central venous catheter terminates at the junction of the
 brachiocephalic vein and SVC.  There is no pneumothorax.  Moderate right and
 small left layering pleural effusions are slightly increased on the right.
 Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is also unchanged. An unchanged
 retrocardiac airspace opacity may either be due to infection or atelectasis.
 
 The followup radiograph of 10:17 shows interval placement of a feeding tube,
 which enters the stomach.  Aeration at the left lung base continues to
 improve. There is no other significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube replaced with a feeding tube, which enters the stomach.
 Slightly improved aeration at the left lung base. Otherwise no significant
 interval change.
