                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old man with altered mental status and cough, evaluate
 for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right chest central line is again seen with distal tip projecting over the
 right atrium. Tracheostomy tube remains in place. An enteric tube courses
 inferiorly, with distal tip projecting below the lower limit of the
 radiograph. Multiple median sternotomy wires are again identified.  Right PICC
 line is in stable position, with distal tip projecting over the mid-low SVC.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable, consistent with mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly. The bilateral hila are unremarkable. Bilateral diffuse airspace
 opacities likely represent pulmonary edema which is worsened in comparison to
 prior exam; however, a more confluent opacity within the left mid-lung raises
 the possibility of superimposed pneumonia.
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and a focal area of right-sided pleural
 margin thickening are generally unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval worsening of at least moderate pulmonary edema. Confluent opacity
 within the left mid lung raises the possibility of superimposed infection.
 2. Stable moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
