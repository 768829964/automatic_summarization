                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p open AAA repair who is now s/p chest
 tube removal.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam dated ___ at 08:49.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Multiple overlying EKG wires are
 presence somewhat limiting evaluation. Skin ___ along the left flank
 region noted. There is mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Given the
 lack of the lateral projection, left lower lobe pathology difficult to
 exclude. There is likely a small left effusion with left basal atelectasis.
 Right lung appears clear though the right CP angle is excluded. The heart is
 top-normal in size. The mediastinal contour is stable with tortuosity of the
 thoracic aorta noted. No pneumothorax is present. Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. Probable small left effusion with
 left basal atelectasis. Consider lateral view to better assess for underlying
 abnormality. Otherwise unremarkable exam.
