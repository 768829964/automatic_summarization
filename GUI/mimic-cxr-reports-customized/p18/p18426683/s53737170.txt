                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG  // eval effusion      eval effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitor and support devices
 are unchanged.  There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 some enlargement of pulmonary venous pressure. Increasing haziness of the
 right hemithorax suggests further accumulation of pleural effusion with
 underlying compressive atelectasis. Retrocardiac opacification is consistent
 with volume loss left lower lobe, probably with associated pleural fluid.
