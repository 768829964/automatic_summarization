 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the nasogastric
 tube is now visualized.  It projects over the prepyloric region of the
 stomach. The lung volumes have slightly increased as compared to the previous
 examination, potentially resulting from increased ventilatory pressure.
