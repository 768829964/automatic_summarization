                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea and hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  In addition to upper zone redistribution of pulmonary vascularity
 and enlarged indistinct hila, a widespread interstitial abnormality also
 suggests pulmonary vascular congestion.  Due to technique, it is difficult to
 assess each costophrenic sulcus, but small effusions are possible.  The heart
 appears at least mild to moderately enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
