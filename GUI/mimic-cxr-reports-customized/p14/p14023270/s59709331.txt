 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of endotracheal tube, with tip terminating
 approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube has also been placed,
 but is not confidently visualized beyond the midthoracic esophagus on this
 relatively underpenetrated radiograph.  Cardiac silhouette remains enlarged
 and is accompanied by worsening asymmetrical alveolar edema pattern, affecting
 the right lung to a greater degree than the left.  Dense left retrocardiac
 opacity is new and may reflect a combination of atelectasis, dependent edema,
 and effusion.
