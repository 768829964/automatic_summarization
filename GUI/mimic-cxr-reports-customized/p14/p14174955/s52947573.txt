                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with diverticulitis, A-fib, diastolic CHF, s/p
 V-fib arrest, now intubated.  // please assess location of ET tube
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ portable chest radiograph
 ___ portable chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval intubation with an endotracheal tube which terminates 2.3 cm above
 the carina and placement of a right IJ central venous catheter which
 terminates near the cavoatrial junction.  Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
 Apparent mediastinal widening is likely exaggerated by patient rotation,
 unchanged compared to ___.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 No focal airspace opacity.  No pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  A left
 pectoralis single chamber cardiac pacemaker is again noted with a lead that
 terminates likely within the right ventricle.  Mild thoracic levoscoliosis is
 noted.  Prominent gaseous distention of the stomach should not be mistaken for
 free air under the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 2.3 cm above the carina.  Severe cardiomegaly
 and mild pulmonary vascular congestion are unchanged.
