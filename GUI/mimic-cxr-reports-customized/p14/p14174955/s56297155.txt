 AP CHEST, 8:28 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Check ET tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 12:16 p.m.:
 
 Tip of the new endotracheal tube is at the upper margin of the clavicles, no
 less than 4 cm from the carina.  Respiratory motion obscures fine anatomic
 detail in the lungs, but there is no pulmonary edema or large consolidation. 
 Severe cardiomegaly has increased, now accompanied by small bilateral pleural
 effusion.  Supraclavicular left internal jugular introducer ends at the
 junction of the brachiocephalic veins.  No pneumothorax is evident, though
 pleural surfaces might be obscured by respiratory motion.  Subsequent chest
 radiograph, 9:34 p.m., showed no pneumothorax.
