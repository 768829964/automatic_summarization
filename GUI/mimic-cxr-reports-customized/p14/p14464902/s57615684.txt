 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is improved
 transparency of the lung parenchyma, likely reflecting improved ventilation. 
 Minimal fluid overload remains present but is certainly less severe than on
 the previous image.  Moderate cardiomegaly, left pectoral pacemaker.
