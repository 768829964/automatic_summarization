                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST FILM ___ AT 741 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with question volume overload, assess for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A single portable upright chest film ___ at 741 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Dual-lead left-sided pacemaker with its leads terminating over the
 expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle respectively.  Left
 internal jugular central line has its tip in the proximal superior vena cava. 
 Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip approximately 3 cm above the
 carina.  Nasogastric tube seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.
 
 2.  The heart remains mildly enlarged but unchanged.  Mediastinal contours are
 within normal limits.  Interval improvement in aeration with improving mild
 pulmonary and interstitial edema.  Probable small layering right effusion. 
 More patchy opacity at the left base may reflect a combination of compressive
 atelectasis and effusion, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
