 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia status post trach, assess for

 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 424 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Single-lead right-sided pacer remains in place, unchanged in position.  A
 right subclavian PICC line remains in place with its tip in the proximal SVC. 
 An endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.  There are likely
 small layering bilateral effusions. Retrocardiac consolidation persists and
 there are also patchy opacities noted at the right base suggestive of
 atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, there is no
 significant interval change.
