                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough and fever. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  There is a
 right-sided pacemaker with a single right ventricular lead, as before.  A
 small left pleural effusion is minimally increased.  Left lower lung
 consolidative opacities could be atelectasis, although infection in this
 region is certainly possible, not significantly changed compared to the prior
 study from ___.  There is a minimal right lower lobe atelectasis. 
 There is a small right pleural effusion.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slightly increased small left pleural effusion with left lower lung
 consolidative opacities that could be atelectasis, although underlying
 infection is not excluded. 
 
 2.  Minimal right lower lung atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.
