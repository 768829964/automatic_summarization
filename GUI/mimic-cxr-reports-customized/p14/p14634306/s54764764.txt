 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is increasing
 opacification at the right base, consistent with pleural fluid and atelectatic
 changes.  On the left, the hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen, consistent with
 improvement in the degree of collapse in the left lower lobe.  Mild blunting
 of the costophrenic angle persists.
 The monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
