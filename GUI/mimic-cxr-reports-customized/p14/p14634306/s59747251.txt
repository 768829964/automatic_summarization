                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia and pneumonia.  Evaluate for volume overload.  
 
 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest dated ___ and multiple prior radiographs
 of chest dated ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates increased
 opacification of the left upper lung field consistent with pneumonia.  There
 is a small area of increased opacification of the left base, which likely
 represents atelectasis.  There is a stable appearing right upper lung nodule. 
 The cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  The heart is top normal in
 size.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The right-sided internal
 jugular central venous line ends at the cavoatrial junction.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased opacification of the left upper lobe is most suggestive of
 pneumonia.
