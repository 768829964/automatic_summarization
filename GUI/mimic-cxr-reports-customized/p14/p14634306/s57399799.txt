 infection, and for CVL kinks
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 15:15
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 15:34 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The right large bore dual lumen internal jugular catheter is unchanged in
 position and does not demonstrate any kinks.  A left internal jugular central
 line terminates in the proximal SVC.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely unchanged.  There is interval worsening of
 mild to moderate pulmonary and interstitial edema.  Retrocardiac consolidation
 most likely reflects atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  There are likely layering small effusions.
