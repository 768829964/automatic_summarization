                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancreatitis, respiratory failure, evaluate ET tube position,
 infection.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  Technologist note as follows "patient
 continuously coughing side to side in bed, unable to calm patient down, best
 images possible."
 
 There is mild blurring.  Allowing for this, the ET tube tip appears to lie
 approximately 2.9 cm above the carina.  An orogastric-type tube is present,
 tip extending beneath diaphragm off film. There is a possible second
 orogastric-type tube present, tip lying in region of GE junction.  A right IJ
 central line is present, the tip is poorly visualized, but probably unchanged
 compared with one day earlier. 
 
 There are bilateral effusions, slightly greater on the left, with underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation.  How much of the appearance is attributable to 
 supine lordotic positioning is  difficult to determine.   The overall
 appearance of the lungs and effusions is grossly unchanged compared with
 yesterday's film.
