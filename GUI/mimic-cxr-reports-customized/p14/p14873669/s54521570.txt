                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2 cm above the
 carina with the neck apparently in a flexed position.  Other indwelling
 devices are unchanged in position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable. 
 Lung volumes are low, accentuating the bronchovascular structures.  Persistent
 bibasilar atelectasis and layering pleural effusions.  Diffuse haziness in
 imaged upper abdomen corresponds to ascites on recent abdominal CT scan.
