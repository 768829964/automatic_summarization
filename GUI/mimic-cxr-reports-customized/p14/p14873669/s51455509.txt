                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with pancreatitis, respiratory failure and
 malfunctioning central line.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable semi-upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Lung
 volumes are very low.  There are moderate bilateral layering effusions. 
 Endotracheal tube ends at the mid clavicular heads.  Right internal jugular
 line tip remains in is unchanged position, likely in the central left
 brachiocephalic vein near the confluence with the SVC.  An orogastric tube
 extends inferiorly off the film.  The visualized cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Left-sided internal jugular catheter in unchanged but atypical position. 
 The tip may be in the bracheocepalic vein, but if the line continues to
 malfunciton, suggest new line placement.
 2.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
