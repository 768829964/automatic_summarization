 is likely very distended and oblong.  Some residual radiopaque material is
 seen projecting over the gastric fundus.  Lung volumes are low.  There is a
 probable left-sided pleural effusion.  There is some minimal pulmonary
 vascular redistribution.  The heart is upper limits of normal in size.  ET
 tube is 3.5 cm above the carina.
