  pneumonia/aspiration.
  2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged from ___,
  accounting for differences in positioning.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Sepsis. Evaluate right upper extremity PICC and evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Bedside frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___ and
 abdominal radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy is 4.4 cm above the carina.  A right upper extremity PICC has
 been retracted and now terminates in the brachiocephalic vein, near the
 junction with the superior vena cava.  The percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube
 is coiled within the stomach and directed retrograde.
 
 There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  Retrocardiac consolidation
 with air bronchograms is unchanged may be overlying atelectasis, however,
 pneumonia is not excluded.  An additional focal opacification is seen in the
 right upper lobe.  Aspirated barium is seen in the right lower lobe.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New right upper lobe opacity is worrisome for pneumonia/aspiration.
 2. Moderate bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged from ___,
 accounting for differences in positioning.
 3. Percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube is coiled within the stomach and
 directed retrograde. Repositioning is recommended.
 4. Withdrawal of the right upper extremity PICC, now terminating in the
 brachiocephalic vein.
