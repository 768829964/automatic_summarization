                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bacteremia with lead-associated vegetations
 and IVDU who is intubated with GT.  // Comparison to previous.     Comparison
 to previous.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 08:11
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The endotracheal tube and the nasogastric tube are unchanged position. A
 single lead left-sided pacer is in place.  Since the prior study, there is
 increased opacity within the right lower lung which is concerning for either
 partial lower lobe collapse with associated effusion or developing pneumonia
 with an associated effusion. Clinical correlation is advised. Improved
 aeration at the left base and the left lung is grossly clear. The pulmonary
 vasculature appears less prominent and therefore the superimposed edema has
 resolved.  Clips in the right upper quadrant consistent with prior
 cholecystectomy.
