                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p MVR/TVr/CABG  // eval for pleural effusions
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 08:09
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube tip lies approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is
 present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.  Left IJ central line tip
 overlies the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.  Allowing for this, cardiomediastinal
 enlargement appears similar to prior.  The patient has a known ascending
 aortic aneurysm.  Sternotomy wires again seen.  The patient has mitral and
 tricuspid valve replacements.
 
 There are extensive opacities throughout both lungs.  This appears to reflect
 the presence of CHF with interstitial and alveolar edema, however, the
 presence of background infectious infiltrates would be difficult to exclude in
 this setting.
 
 There is persistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and a
 probable small left effusion, similar to prior.  Previously seen small right
 effusion is less apparent on this exam, though could still be present.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly, unchanged.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion are
 similar to the prior study.
 
 Extensive bilateral infiltrates.  These appear more pronounced compared with
 the prior film, but are also likely accentuated by differences in technique. 
 This could represent CHF, but underlying pneumonic infiltrates cannot be
 excluded.
 
 No gross right effusion, though a small effusion might not be apparent.
