                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion, cardiogenic vs septic
 shock  // eval for evolving PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with prior radiographs on ___, there is been marked
 contraction of intravascular volume and or pressure.  There has been a
 decrease in pulmonary artery volume and cardiomediastinal silhouette, although
 there is still pulmonary vascular congestion.   The previous, left dominant
 lower lobe opacification on radiographs on ___, is now right
 side dominant, and partially improved since ___, suggesting
 position-dependent edema rather than pneumonia, however rapidly resolving left
 basal pneumonia and subsequent right pneumonia, particularly due to recurrent
 aspiration, is still a possibility.  There is a small left pleural effusion. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The PA catheter ends in the right descending
 pulmonary artery, and should be withdrawn 2-3 cm to be in a more standard
 position.  ET and NG tubes are appropriately positioned.  Left pleural drain
 is unchanged.  There has been interval removal of the intra aortic balloon
 pump.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Improvement in intravascular volume and/or pressure.
 2.  Swan-Ganz catheter ending in the periphery of the right pulmonary artery
 should be withdrawn to 2-3 cm to be in a more standard position.
 3.  Interval improvement, right lower lobe consolidation, and clearing of left
 basal consolidation, either position dependent, asymmetric edema, less likely
 rapidly changing pneumonia, presumably due to aspiration.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephoneon ___ at 10:23 AM, 30 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
