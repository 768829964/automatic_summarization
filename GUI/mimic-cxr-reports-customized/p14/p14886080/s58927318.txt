                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with effusion and pneumothorax s/p chest tube  //
 ___ for pneumo, effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Support lines and tubes are unchanged in position when compared to the prior
 study.  There is a persistent airspace opacity in the right upper lobe,
 unchanged compared to the prior study.  The right apical pneumothorax is not
 definitely visualized on today's study.  Certainly this has not significantly
 increased.  There is a small left pleural effusion, similar when compared to
 the prior study.  Mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and mild
 cardiomegaly is consistent with mild congestive heart failure.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.  The
 previously seen right apical pneumothorax is not clearly visualized on today's
 study.
