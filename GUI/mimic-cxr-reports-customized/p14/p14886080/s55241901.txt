                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with CKD III, likely from microvacular disease ___ long
 standing HTN/DM, PVD, CAD who presents with newly diagnosed malignant effusion
 (B cell lymphoma?) with admission c/b STEMI/Vtach arrest s/p LHC w/
 angioplasty and BMS to RCA, and subsequent septic shock. Course also c/b
 cdiff.  // chest tube placement, eval pleural effusion   chest tube placement,
 eval pleural effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the left subclavian PICC line tip
 extends to the mid portion of the SVC.  Dobhoff tube extends at least to the
 upper stomach, where it passes the lower margin of the image.
 Persistent airspace opacity in the right upper zone.  The cardiac silhouette
 remains mildly enlarged with mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  No
 definite pleural effusion on this side.
 On the left, there is increased opacification at the base with blunting of the
 costophrenic angle.  This is consistent with volume loss in the left lower
 lobe and pleural fluid.  Right chest tube remains in place and there is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.
