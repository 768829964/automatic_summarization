                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with LVAD, now w/ new fever, new O2 requirement 
 // ? PNA, r/o any abnl      ? PNA, r/o any abnl
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Again there is huge enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with relatively mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion, a discordance that suggests underlying
 cardiomyopathy.  LVAD remains in place.
 Given the size of the heart, it it would be impossible to exclude the
 possibility of superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting,
 especially in the absence of a lateral view.
