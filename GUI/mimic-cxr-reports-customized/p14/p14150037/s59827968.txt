 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left-sided single lead pacer remains in place with the lead terminating over
 the expected location of the right ventricle.  Status post median sternotomy. 
 The right internal jugular central line has its tip in the mid SVC. 
 Tracheostomy tube and feeding tube are likely unchanged in position, although
 the tip of the feeding tube is not included on the image.  There continues to
 be a bilateral diffuse airspace and interstitial process likely reflecting
 severe pulmonary edema but diffuse infection or ARDS should also be
 considered.  The heart remains enlarged likely reflecting cardiomegaly,
 although pericardial effusion cannot be excluded.  No obvious pneumothorax.
