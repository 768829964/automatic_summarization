  Mild pulmonary edema is not appreciably changed since ___.  There is
  no new focal airspace opacity to suggest pneumonia.  Persistent left
  retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis and pleural effusion, however
  an underlying pneumonia would be difficult to exclude in this region.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with LVAD, now concern for volume overload and
 possible recurrent PNA.  // evaluate for new evidence of PNA.  Eval location
 of PICC line.     evaluate for new evidence of PNA.  Eval location of PICC
 line.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there again is substantial enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette with relatively mild pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Persistent opacification in the low left retrocardiac area of most likely
 reflects a combination of atelectasis and effusion.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia could be considered.
 The monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
