  1. Stable positioning of multiple support lines/devices.
  2. There is moderately severe pulmonary edema.  Increasing opacification of
  the left upper lobe may reflect worsening edema, or developing consolidation. 
  Close interval follow-up is recommended.

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison the previous study from earlier the same date, support and
 monitoring devices remain in standard position.  Moderately severe pulmonary
 edema has slightly changed in distribution but is overall similar in severity.
 Note is made of slight improvement in aeration in the left retrocardiac
 region.  No other relevant change in the short interval between the 2 studies.
