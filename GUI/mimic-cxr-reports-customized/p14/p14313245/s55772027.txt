                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE 23:21 HOURS
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with large subarachnoid hemorrhage and
 craniotomy, hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:
 
 The tracheal tube is well above the carina.  Right subclavian catheter is
 unchanged.  Nasogastric tube is noted.
 
 In both lung bases there are slightly increased markings.  This could
 represent atelectasis, but followup is recommended.  Lung volumes are
 relatively low.  Heart is not enlarged.  Aorta is slightly ectsatic.
 
 CONCLUSION:  In both lung bases the markings have increased somewhat.  This
 could represent atelectasis but early consolidations should be considered. 
 Followup recommended.
