                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Increased rhonchi, respiratory insufficiency.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  Widened
 mediastinum due to vascular engorgement is stable.  Bilateral effusions are
 probably unchanged on the right and minimally increased on the left allowing
 the difference in positioning of the patient.  Tracheostomy tube is in
 standard position.  Right PICC tip is in at the cavoatrial junction.  Spinal
 hardware is again noted.
