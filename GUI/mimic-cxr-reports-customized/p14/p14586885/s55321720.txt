                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after tracheostomy
 placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed.
 
 The tracheostomy was placed with its tip terminating approximately 4 cm above
 the carina.  Right lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusion are more
 pronounced than on the prior study and might reflect aspiration.  Mild
 vascular engorgement is noted.
 
 Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of superior SVC.
