                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess NG tube, patient is status post cardiac arrest.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Cardiac size is top normal, is accentuated by low lung volumes.  Right lower
 lobe opacity has minimally increased.  As mentioned before, this is worrisome
 for aspiration.  There is no pneumothorax.  Of note, the right lateral CP
 angle was not included on the film.  NG tube is just distal to the GE junction
 and should be advanced for standard position.
