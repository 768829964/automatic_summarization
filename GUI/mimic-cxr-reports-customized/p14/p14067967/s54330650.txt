                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 Intubated with continued respiratory failure and concern for pneumonia. 
 Compare to prior.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi upright bedside chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Study is somewhat limited by patient positioning.  The endotracheal tube
 terminates 5 cm above the carinal.  A left pectoral pacemaker is constant.  A
 right internal jugular central venous catheter courses into the low SVC. An
 enteric tube courses through the esophagus.
 
 Streaky opacity at the left lung base is presumably atelectasis.  There is no
 focal airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  No pleural effusion,
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  Heart is normal size and the mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Within limitations of this exam, no change from yesterday morning.
