                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates 6.5 cm above the carina and
 could be advanced slightly for standard positioning.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are normal and without change.  Slight interval improved aeration in
 left retrocardiac region with residual opacity that likely represents
 atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion is also demonstrated.
