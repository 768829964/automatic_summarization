                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Right thalamic intraparenchymal hemorrhage,
 assessment for interval change.
 
 AP chest radiograph.
 
 As compared to the prior study obtained on ___ at 5:50 p.m., there is
 interval progression of widespread parenchymal consolidations on the right
 side.  Left side is overall unchanged.  When compared to ___, there
 is overall gradual worsening of the involvement of the lung by diffuse
 consolidations.  The differential diagnosis is broad and infection is a
 possibility.  Attentively ARDS might be a potential etiology.  Correlation
 with chest CT might be considered.
