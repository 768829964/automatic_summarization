                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chronic respiratory failure and poor
 neurologic status post-thalamic bleed  // evaluate for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased,
 potentially reflecting improved ventilation. Unchanged tracheostomy tube,
 unchanged right PICC line.  The pre-existing parenchymal opacities,
 predominating on the right, are improved but still clearly visualized. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic sinus so that the minimal left pleural
 effusion cannot be excluded.
