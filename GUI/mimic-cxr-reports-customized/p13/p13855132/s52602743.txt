                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure requiring prolonged
 intubation  // assess pulmonary edema      assess pulmonary edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 ET tube in standard placement.  Right PIC line ends in the low SVC. 
 Nasogastric drainage tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
 
 Minimal improvement in the left perihilar component of bilateral pulmonary
 abnormality, could be edema, but the presence of a moderate to large right
 pleural effusion and at least small left pleural effusion obscures much of
 both lungs and I would not want to misdiagnose multifocal pneumonia as edema. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly stable.  No pneumothorax.
