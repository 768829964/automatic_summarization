 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ PMH of HTN, dementia w/ babesiosis and grade III splenic
 laceration s/p splenic artery embolization (___), admitted to TSICU with w/
 hypoxic respiratory failure requiring prolonged intubation.  Now s/p trach/PEG
 (___), tolerating trach mask and TFs with respiratory distress on  // s/p b/l
 thoracentesis; eval for PTX, injury   s/p b/l thoracentesis; eval for PTX,
 injury
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Previous moderate pulmonary edema has substantially improved.  Residual
 opacification at the lung bases could be explained by persistent edema and
 atelectasis, but worsening opacification in the left lower lobe raises concern
 for concurrent pneumonia or loose worsening atelectasis.  Small pleural
 effusions are presumed.  Mild cardiomegaly has worsened.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Right PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.  Tracheostomy
 tube roughly midline.
