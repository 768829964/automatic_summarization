                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pancreatitis and open abdomen, to evaluate for consolidation,
 effusion, collapse.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was reviewed in comparison with
 prior chest radiographs, with the most recent from ___, approximately
 24 hours apart.
 
 FINDINGS: Right lower lung volume loss secondary to right lower lobe collapse
 is overall unchanged. Any contribution from collapsed right middle lobe is
 indeterminate.  Mild left lower lung opacity is probably atelectasis and
 constant.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, widened mediastinum and
 moderate cardiomegaly is similar.  Endotracheal tube ends 6.5 cm above the
 carina, right subclavian line tip is in the right upper atrium, right internal
 jugular sheath tip is at mid SVC, single lead from left pectoral ICD ends into
 the right ventricle, while feeding tube and orogastric tube terminate into the
 stomach appropriately.  Pleural effusion, if any, are small bilaterally and
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Over last 24 hours, right lower lobe collapse is unchanged.  Any
 contribution from middle lobe collapse is indeterminate.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular and mediastinal congestion, moderately enlarged heart and presumed
 small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.
