 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with tracheostomy placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CHEST, AP:  A tracheostomy tube terminates 2.7 cm from the carina.  Right
 ventricular pacemaker/defibrillator lead courses in standard position.  Right
 internal jugular catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  Right subclavian
 catheter ends at the cavoatrial junction.  Dobhoff tube tip is at the proximal
 duodenum.  There is no significant pneumothorax.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are present.  Lung volumes remain low, with improved bibasilar and
 persistent middle lobe atelectasis.  Mild cardiomegaly, central venous
 congestion, and interstitial edema have slightly progressed.  Thoracic aorta
 is tortuous and calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Low lung volumes, with decreased bibasilar atelectasis.
 2.  Slight increase in pulmonary edema.
