                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with vehicular polytrauma and ARDS.  Evaluate
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-erect frontal view of the chest was obtained.  Left PICC
 terminates in the upper SVC, and tracheostomy and PEG are in stable position. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle is compatible with a small left
 pleural effusion, similar to prior.  Retrocardiac opacity is compatible with
 atelectasis and similar to prior.  Right basilar opacity has worsened
 medially, and a new patchy opacity has developed peripherally at the right
 lung base.   No pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable small left pleural effusion and retrocardiac atelectasis. 
 New focal peripheral right basilar opacity could reflect focal atelectasis or
 early pneumonia. Attention to this region on follow up CXR may be helpful.
