                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 9:33 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, patient has received an
 endotracheal tube.  The tip of the tube projects 1 cm above the carina and
 should be pulled back by approximately 2 to 3 cm.  The patient has also
 received a nasogastric tube, the tube is in correct position.  There is no
 evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.  The right internal
 jugular venous introduction sheath is unchanged.  The lung volumes have
 slightly improved, potentially as a reflection of the increased ventilatory
 pressure.
 
 However, the moderate cardiomegaly and signs of relatively extensive left
 lower lobe atelectasis persist.
