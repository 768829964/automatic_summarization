                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post bronch.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are low, accentuating pulmonary vasculature.  Despite
 this limitation, there is mild persistent pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Retrocardiac opacity is unchanged.  An endotracheal tube tip terminates at the
 clavicular heads.  A right internal jugular line is kinked in the subcutaneous
 tissues but the tip is in the mid SVC.  A Dobbhoff tube loops in the stomach. 
 Median sternotomy wires are intact.  Mediastinal clips are in expected
 positions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged appearance of mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
 2.  Unchanged retrocardiac opacity, may represent atelectasis or consolidation
 depending on the clinical context.
