                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with placement of Dobbhoff tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to the prior study performed two hours earlier.
 
 There is again seen a Dobbhoff tube whose distal tip is in the fundus of the
 stomach.  The tip has been pulled back slightly and the loop is smaller than
 on the prior study.  There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 5 cm above the
 carina appropriately sited.  There is a left-sided subclavian catheter with
 distal lead tip in the proximal SVC, slightly perpendicular to SVC wall. 
 There is an unchanged left retrocardiac opacity and a left-sided pleural
 effusion.  There are no pneumothoraces.  The right lung is relatively clear.
