                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ARDS, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimal
 improvement in lung ventilation, likely reflecting increased ventilatory
 pressure.  No new parenchymal opacities but the widespread pre-existing
 opacities are almost unchanged.  The monitoring and support devices are
 constant.  No pneumothorax.
