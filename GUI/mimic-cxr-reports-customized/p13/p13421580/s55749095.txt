                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with ascites, esophageal varices,
 Dobbhoff line placed, check position.
 
 AP single view of the lower chest was obtained covering the upper abdomen.  A
 Dobbhoff line is seen to have passed well below the diaphragm and curling up
 in the left upper abdominal quadrant presumably located in the fundus of the
 stomach.  If the purpose of the line placement was to pass through the pylorus
 into the duodenum, further advancement would be necessary.  As the patient has
 a markedly distended abdomen presumably related to ascites, supervision of
 these manipulations with fluoroscopy may be helpful.
