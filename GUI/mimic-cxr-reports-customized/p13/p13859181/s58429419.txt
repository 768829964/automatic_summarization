                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute heart failure needing hemodynamic monitoring and placement
 of a pulmonary arterial catheter.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright bedside chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 A right pulmonary arterial catheter is unchanged in position from yesterday
 morning, terminating within the right main pulmonary artery.  A left internal
 jugular central line courses into the low SVC.
 
 There has been an increase in opacity in the right lower lung, consistent with
 increasing edema. Opacification of the left base is unchanged and is
 presumably atelectasis.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Increasing right lower lung pulmonary edema. 2. Unchanged positioning of
 the pulmonary arterial catheter, terminating in the right main pulmonary
 artery.
