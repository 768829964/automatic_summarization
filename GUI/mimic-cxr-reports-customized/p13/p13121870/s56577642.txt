 As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing gastric over
 distension has completely resolved. The left pleural effusion and the
 retrocardiac atelectasis are unchanged. The appearance of the lung parenchyma
 is constant and there is no evidence for new focal parenchymal opacities
 suggesting pneumonia or pulmonary hemorrhage.  Moderate overinflation
 persists. The nasogastric tube should be slightly advanced by approximately 5
 cm. The endotracheal tube continues to be in correct position.
