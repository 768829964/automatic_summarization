                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 546 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated with bilateral pulmonary
 infiltrates, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 528.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 546 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  A right subclavian central line remains in position with its tip in the
 distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction.  Dual-lead left-sided pacer with its
 leads terminating over the expected location of the right atrium and right
 ventricle, respectively.  Markedly low lung volumes with crowding of the
 pulmonary vasculature with indistinct vasculature on the left raising a
 concern for asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacity at the right base may
 reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  A mid to
 distal left clavicular fracture is again seen.  No pneumothorax.
