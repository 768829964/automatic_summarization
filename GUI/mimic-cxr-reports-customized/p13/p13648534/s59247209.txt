                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change in a patient status post
 high-speed motor vehicle crash with rib fractures, pneumothoraces, and
 parenchymal hemorrhage.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___
 and CT torso, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP supine view of the chest was reviewed.  An endotracheal
 tube ends 4 cm above the carina.  Left-sided Port-A-Cath ends in the lower
 superior vena cava.  An upper enteric tube passes into the stomach and off the
 radiograph.  Right upper lung and perihilar opacity representing
 intraparenchymal hemorrhage has improved.  Lung volumes have increased and
 right lower lobe atelectasis has decreased. A  small right pleural effusion is
 relatively unchanged.  The previously described moderate right apical
 pneumothorax is now miniscule.  In the right lung apex, there is a redundant
 fragment of unidentified wire or lead that has been present on several prior
 studies.  A left pectoral biventricular pacer and defibrillator has pacer
 leads ending in the right atrium and left ventricle and a defibrillator lead
 ends in the right ventricle.  Bilateral subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged. 
 A left clavicular fracture is again noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small right pleural effusion and minimal right apical pneumothorax. 
 Possible upright films would better evaluate the extent of the pleural
 efufsion and pneumothorax.
 2.  Improvement right lung opacities indicates improvement in right
 parenchymal hemorrhage and lower lobe atelectasis.
