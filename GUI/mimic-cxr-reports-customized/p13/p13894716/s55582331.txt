                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ s/p cardiac arrest with h/o DM, COPD, HTN presenting as
 transfer from OSH for post cardiac arrest care, shock, and respiratory
 failure.  // interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 02:48
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube tip lies above the carina.  The NG tube tip is poorly visualized
 lower mediastinum and beyond due to underpenetration.  A right IJ central line
 tip overlies distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 There is cardiomegaly.  There is CHF, with interstitial and alveolar edema. 
 There is opacification of both lung bases, which could represent a combination
 of pleural fluid and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Allowing for
 technical differences, the degree of CHF appears increased slightly compared
 with ___ at 02:48
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 CHF with interstitial and alveolar edema.  This appears slightly worse
 compared with ___
 
 Opacity at both lung bases which likely represents combination of pleural
 effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 
  NG tube not well visualized in lower esophagus and beyond due to
 underpenetration.
