                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  To evaluate for reaccumulation of hemothorax, pneumothorax, or
 consolidation.  Status post chest trauma, sternotomy, repair of subclavian
 artery.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was read in comparison with prior
 radiographs with the most recent from yesterday acquired ___ hours apart.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 5 cm above the carina and orogastric
 tube courses below the diaphragm; however, its distal end is off the
 radiographic view.  Apart from preexisting two chest tubes on the right side
 and a chest tube on the left side, there are two new mediastinal drain tubes,
 one ending in the lower mediastinum, while another is in the upper medistinum.
 Since yesterday, there has been a substantial improvement in the widened
 mediastinum concerning for hematoma, which is mostly from post-surgical
 evacuation, as reflected by an open sternum with skin ___.  There has been
 significant improvement in the moderately severe pulmonary edema and residual
 opacity in the right upper-mid lung is a combination of
 hemorrhage/atelectasis.  Left apical pneumothorax is small.  Pleural
 effusions, if any, are minimal bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Since yestarday, following surgical evacuations, widened mediastinum secondary
 to hematoma and moderately severe pulmonary edema have substantial improved
 and small left apical pneumothorax is new. Residual right upper-mid lung
 opacity is mostly combination of hemorrhage and/or atelectasis.
