                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p esophagectomy with chest tube  // assess
 chest tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 14:53
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An NG type tube is present.  The tip overlies the lower mediastinum,
 presumably in relation to the distal neo esophagus, similar to the prior film.
 
 Again seen is left-sided chest tube, with skin ___ and subcutaneous
 emphysema seen along the lower left chest wall.  As before, tube lies along
 the lateral aspect of the chest wall.  A tiny residual pneumothorax is likely
 present.  Previously seen postoperative pneumoperitoneum is no longer
 visualized.
 
 Mild prominence the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 Upper zone redistribution an bibasilar atelectasis upper zone redistribution
 is similar to the prior film.  Platelike atelectasis and bibasilar atelectasis
 is more pronounced.  Patent GE retrocardiac opacity is slightly more
 pronounced.  No gross effusion.  No right-sided pneumothorax.
 
 Small (6.9 mm), nonaggressive rounded lucency in the right proximal humeral
 diaphysis, with sclerotic rim, is similar to ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable tiny residual left apical pneumothorax.
 
 Increased atelectasis in the left mid zone and at both bases.
 
 Nonaggressive small rounded lucency in the right proximal humerus, unchanged
 compared with ___.  -- is there history of prior
 shoulder biceps surgery to account for this?  If not, the most likely
 differential diagnosis would include normal variant changes at a muscle
 insertion site.  In the absence of local symptoms, recommend followup right
 shoulder radiographs in approximately 6 months to confirm expected stability.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Small nonaggressive lucency in right proximal humeral
 diaphysis.  In the absence of local symptoms, recommend followup right
 shoulder radiographs in approximately 6 months to confirm expected stability.
