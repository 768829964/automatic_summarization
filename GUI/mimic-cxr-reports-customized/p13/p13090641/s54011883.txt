 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Left pleural effusion, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a subtle increase
 in extent and severity of the pre-existing left pleural effusion.  The left
 retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.  Unchanged minimal increase in diameter
 of the pulmonary vasculature, indicative of mild fluid overload.  Normal size
 of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged position of the tracheostomy tube and
 the left PICC line.
