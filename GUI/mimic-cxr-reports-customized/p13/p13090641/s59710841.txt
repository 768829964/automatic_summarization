                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Follow up pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 10 hours earlier.
 
 Study is limited due to overlying board artifact.  Left apical pneumothorax is
 less conspicuous than before.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 Lines and tubes are in standard position.  Bilateral rib fractures are again
 noted.  Bibasilar opacities, larger on the right side, could be atelectasis,
 contusion and/or aspiration.  These are grossly unchanged from prior studies. 
 Increased density in the right lung is due to layering pleural effusion.
