                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post MVC with hemothorax, now status post
 left chest tube placement.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube terminates 8.5 cm above
 the carina.  A nasogastric tube follows a normal course but the last side port
 is above the GE junction.  A left-sided chest tube terminates in the medial
 left apex. A left subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the
 brachiocephalic vein. 
 
 There is minimal left apical pleural fluid as before.  Right apical
 atelectasis has improved. Newly apparent diffuse increased opacity in the
 right hemithorax is probably due to layering pleural effusion. Bilateral rib
 fractures are again seen.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left thoracostomy tube in unchanged position.
 
 2.  Endotracheal tube terminates 8.5 cm above the carina and could be
 advanced.
 
 3.  Nasogastric tube with last side port above the GE junction.  Recommend
 advancing at least 3 cm.
 
 4.  Increased opacity in the right hemithorax suggests layering pleural fluid.
