                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:36 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Motor vehicle collision.  Previous pneumothorax.  Check ET tube and
 other support devices.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, most recently 4:40 p.m.:
 
 ET tube and enteric drainage tube in standard placements.  Left apical pleural
 tube in place.  Although there is no separation of the pleural surfaces in the
 left hemithorax with the patient supine, anterior pleural air could be
 present.  There is no mediastinal displacement.  The combination of right
 apical pulmonary contusion and extrapulmonary hematoma is relatively stable. 
 Left lower lobe atelectasis has improved.  Layering right pleural effusion is
 small if any.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette below the level of the sternal
 notch is normal.  Spinal fractures are not appreciated and multiple chest cage
 fractures are stable, as far as one can tell.
