                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess pneumothorax, status post chest tube removal.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 There is no evident large pneumothorax.  Layering right pleural effusion has
 markedly decreased.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard position. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Ill-defined left perihilar and left
 lower opacities are grossly unchanged, still they could be due to an
 infectious process, less likely atelectasis.  Right lower lobe opacities,
 likely atelectasis, have improved.
