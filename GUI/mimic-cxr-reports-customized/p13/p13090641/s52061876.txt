                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with T3 transection, tracheostomy, and
 respiratory distress, now with decrease in oxygen saturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a semi-erect position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Back board hardware projects over the midline.  Tracheostomy
 appears to be in standard position.  Left PICC tip appears to have been
 advanced with tip now in the low SVC; this could also reflect patient arm
 positioning.  Left pleural effusion is unchanged.  Bibasilar subsegmental
 atelectasis is seen.  Subtle increased opacity in the right apex may represent
 a small amount of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is detected.  Bilateral rib
 fractures are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Subsegmental atelectasis and persistent left pleural effusion.
