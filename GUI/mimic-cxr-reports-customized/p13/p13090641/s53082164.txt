                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with T3 transection status post tracheostomy
 with purulent secretions.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Tracheostomy tube is noted in standard
 position.  A left IJ catheter tip projects at the cavoatrial junction. 
 Portions of the base of the left lung are not included in the field of view. 
 Within this limitation, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is
 no evidence of large pneumothorax.  The right lower lobe opacity consistent
 with atelectasis is stable.  Minimal perihilar and left lower lobe opacities
 appear stable.  Bilateral rib fractures are again noted.
