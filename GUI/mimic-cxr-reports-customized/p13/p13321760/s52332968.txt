 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post chest tube removal and Dobbhoff
 placement.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.

 FINDINGS:  Sternotomy wires and sternal closure device are intact.  The
 right-sided central line tip sits in the superior SVC.  There has been
 interval removal of the chest tube at the left thoracic base.  Sequential
 images demonstrate advancement of a Dobbhoff tube that initially started
 coiled within the oropharynx and then coiled upon itself in the esophagus and
 then finally coils within the stomach.
 
 The heart size is at the upper limits of normal, but stable.  The mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits.  The lung volumes are low with bibasilar
 atelectasis and small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval removal of chest tube without pneumothorax.
 2.  Feeding tube coiled within the stomach.
