                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with DKA, pneumonia.
 
 STUDY:  Portable semi-upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube sits 3.5 cm above the carina.  The endogastric tube
 side port is well below the GE junction.  Left-sided central line tip sits at
 the lower SVC.
 
 The cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  The lungs demonstrate mild
 interstitial edema, similar to prior studies.  Additionally, subtly increased
 opacity of the right upper lobe is present, and may represent a developing
 consolidative process such as pneumonia.  Indistinctness of the left
 hemidiaphragmatic contour and blunting of the costophrenic sulci may indicate
 small bilateral pleural effusions, but more prominent on the left than the
 right as well as some associated atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes as described above.
 2.  Interstitial pulmonary edema; small bilateral pleural effusions, left
 greater than right.
 3.  Subtle consolidation in the right upper lobe, concerning for evolving
 pneumonia.
