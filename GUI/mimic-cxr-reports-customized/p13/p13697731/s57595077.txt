 jugular central line is unchanged in position.  Nasogastric tube is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.
 
 2.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity likely representing lower lobe collapse. 
 Overall, both lungs appear somewhat hazy, likely representing a component of

 edema is evident.  Heart is upper limits of normal in size given portable
 technique.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  No large pneumothorax
