                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status epilepticus, on pentobarbital.  Evaluate for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates tracheostomy tube in
 standard position.  The left internal jugular central venous catheter tip is
 in the low SVC.  As compared to the prior study, the large right pleural
 effusion is relatively unchanged and the moderate left pleural effusion is
 slightly improved, although this may be due to patient positioning. Left lower
 lobe collapse persists. Stable cardiomegaly. No pneumothorax or strong
 evidence for pneumonia.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Continued bilateral pleural effusions, large on the right and
 moderate on the left, with continued left lower lobe collapse and no strong
 evidence for pneumonia.
