                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with refractory status
 epilepticus with septic shock of unknown origin.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carina.  Feeding tube passes below the
 diaphragm terminating in the stomach.  Left PICC line tip is at the level of
 cavoatrial junction.  Cardiomegaly is present.  There is mild pulmonary edema,
 but infectious process in particular in the left lower lobe and potentially in
 the left upper and lower lobe cannot be excluded given the interval
 development of this parenchymal opacities.  Again, they might be attributable
 to vascular engorgement given the distended azygos vein and volume overload
 but infectious process is a possibility and re-assessment after diuresis is
 recommended.
