                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after right-sided
 thoracocentesis.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier at 04:59 a.m.
 
 After right thoracocentesis and placement of the right pigtail catheter, there
 is substantial decrease in the right pleural effusion and improvement of
 aeration of the right lung with still present small amount of left pleural
 fluid.  Left pleural effusion is present, at least moderate.  Left internal
 jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  The tracheostomy is in place and
 it is slightly impinging the right tracheal wall and should be re-positioned.
