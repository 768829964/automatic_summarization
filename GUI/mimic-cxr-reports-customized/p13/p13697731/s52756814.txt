                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bilateral pleural effusions, here to evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube, enteric tube, left supraclavicular approach
 central venous catheter, and right subclavian approach central venous catheter
 are all in appropriate and stable position from the most recent prior study. 
 The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size but stable.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  Bilateral pleural effusions are not
 significantly changed.  There is improved aeration of the bilateral lung bases
 with persistent mild bilateral infrahilar opacification with air bronchograms
 on the right. No pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of the bilateral lung bases with persistent
 infrahilar opacities may reflect improved pulmonary edema.
