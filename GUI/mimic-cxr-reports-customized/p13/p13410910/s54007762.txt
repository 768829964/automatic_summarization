                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post MVR, TVR, MAZE.  Study
 requested for evaluation of pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube now terminates 6 cm from the carina.  Swan-Ganz
 catheter demonstrates an abrupt angulation at the right ventricle and its tip
 terminates at the right ventricular outflow tract.  The heart is enlarged. 
 There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is improving airspace
 opacity of the right lower lung, which likely represents improving asymmetric
 edema.  However, there is worsening of the left retrocardiac opacity which may
 represent a combination of atelectasis and effusion.  No new focal
 consolidations are identified.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Swan-Ganz catheter demonstrates abrupt angulation within the right
 ventricle, its tip terminates at the right ventricular outflow tract.
 
 2.  Improving asymmetric edema on the right.
 
 3.  Worsening left retrocardiac opacity, which may represent a combination of
 atelectasis and effusion.
