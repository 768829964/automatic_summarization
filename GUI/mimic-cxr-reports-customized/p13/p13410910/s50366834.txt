                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post valve replacement, now with increased O2
 requirements, evaluate for interval change.
 
 CHEST AP
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Film was taken in a semi-upright position.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 present.  Atelectasis of the left base is present.  This was seen on the prior
 chest x-ray.  Comparison with the supine film is somewhat difficult, but I
 think that the effusions have increased.
 
 The tip of the balloon catheter now lies in the region of the aortic arch
 higher than it was on the prior chest x-ray.  The lines and tubes are
 otherwise unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased effusions, intra-aortic balloon catheter tip now in the
 aortic arch.
