                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pleural effusion, status post thoracentesis on the right.  Assess
 for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left PICC ends in the low SVC, as before.  There is
 redemonstration of midline sternotomy wires.
 
 There is evidence of a "deep sulcus sign" on the right with hyperlucency
 outlining the lateral aspect of the right hemidiaphragm, new compared to the
 prior study from ___, concerning for a right pneumothorax.  There
 has been a marked improvement in the degree of pulmonary edema seen on the
 prior study from ___, now with only residual vascular congestion. 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is not significantly changed.  A
 small left pleural effusion is not excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Findings suspicious for a right pneumothorax.  Further evaluation could be
 performed with a well-positioned upright radiograph.
 
 2.  Marked improvement in previously seen pulmonary edema with only residual
 pulmonary vascular congestion on the present study.
 
 3.  Possible small left pleural effusion.
 
 Pertinent findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
 at 5:34 p.m. via telephone on the day of the study.
