                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated, evaluate positions of lines and
 tubes.
 
 Comparison is made to patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 5 cm above the carina.  Left
 internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter continues to have its tip in the pulmonary
 outflow tract.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with
 the tip not identified.  Bilateral chest tubes and mediastinal drains remain
 in place.  Status post median sternotomy with overall stable post-operative
 cardiac and mediastinal contours given patient's rotation.  Interval reduction
 in lung volumes with diffuse airspace process most likely representing
 pulmonary edema given the interval change from ___.  Infectious process
 or ARDS would be less likely.  No large effusions.  No obvious pneumothorax,
 although the sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax would be diminished given
 supine technique.
