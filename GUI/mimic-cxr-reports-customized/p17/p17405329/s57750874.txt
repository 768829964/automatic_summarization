                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post sternotomy.  The cardiac, mediastinal,
 and hilar contours appear unchanged, including marked enlargement of the main
 pulmonary artery.  Interstitial opacification suggests mild pulmonary edema,
 but not nearly as severe as on the prior examination.  There is, however, a
 focal right basilar opacity, for which atelectasis or pneumonia may be
 considered.  It is difficult to exclude small pleural effusions.  
 ]
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary edema, although not nearly as
 severe as on the prior study.  Suspicion for developing right basilar opacity,
 which may be compatible with atelectasis or pneumonia.  Marked enlargement of
 the main pulmonary artery.
