                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with right pneumothorax and significant
 subcutaneous emphysema, assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Portable semi-upright chest radiograph is obtained revealing satisfactory
 position of endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, right IJ central venous
 catheter, and bilateral apically directed chest tubes.  Subcutaneous emphysema
 is unchanged without evidence of pneumothorax.  Left basal atelectasis and
 effusion are unchanged with increase in right basal opacities consistent with
 worsening atelectasis or less likely aspiration.  Mild pulmonary edema is
 slightly increased.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged moderate left and increased moderate right basal
 atelectasis with mild pulmonary edema.
