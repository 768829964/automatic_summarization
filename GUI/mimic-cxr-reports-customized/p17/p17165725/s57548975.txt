                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with chest tube removal, evaluate of
 re-accumulation of fluid.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study of ___.  Previous examination was
 performed with patient in supine position.  The present image was obtained
 with patient in sitting semi-upright position.  Evidence of pleural effusion
 in the form of thickening of the pleural space along the lateral chest wall
 remains unchanged.  The same holds for the diffuse haziness over the right
 lung base presumably caused by some pleural effusion layering in the posterior
 pleural compartments.  The portable chest examinations cannot give any further
 detail concerning the amount of pleural effusion. It appears roughly
 unchanged.  The hemodialysis catheter remains in unchanged position.  Heart
 size enlargement as before.
