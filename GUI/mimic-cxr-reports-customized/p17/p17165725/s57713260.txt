                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of dysphagia, Dobbhoff placement, please evaluate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a right-sided central catheter which terminates in the
 right atrium.  Right-sided PIC line terminates at the mid SVC.  There is
 moderate cardiomegaly with evidence of mild-to-moderate pulmonary vascular
 congestion and mild bilateral pulmonary edema, overall slightly worse compared
 to the prior exam.  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions appear
 stable, however, may be redistributed.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The Dobbhoff tube cannot be seen on this exam.
 
 Per the technologist's note, the Dobbhoff is in the patient's throat and the
 primary team will re-attempt to place the Dobbhoff and request additional
 images.
