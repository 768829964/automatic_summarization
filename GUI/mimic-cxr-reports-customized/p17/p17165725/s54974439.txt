                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent pseudomonas empyema, check tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 3:36 a.m.
 
 There is a dual-lumen central line on the right, with both lead tips over the
 right atrium.  There is a right-sided PICC line, with tip over mid/lower SVC. 
 No pneumothorax is detected.  A pigtail-type catheter overlies the right lung
 base, now over the mid portion of the right hemidiaphragm.  On the prior film,
 it was somewhat more medial in position.  There is upper zone re-distribution
 and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  The right hemidiaphragm
 is slightly elevated, with atelectasis at the right base.  Possible trace
 bilateral effusions.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right pigtail catheter present, lying slightly more lateral than
 on the prior film.  CHF, right base atelectasis, and possible small bilateral
 effusions.  No pneumothorax detected.
