                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pericardial effusion.  Please assess for parenchymal
 consolidations.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube terminates approximately 7 cm from the carina.  There
 is an NG tube which extends below the diaphragm with the tip likely in the
 body of the stomach.  There is a right-sided central line with the tip in the
 mid SVC.  The heart is again severely enlarged, overall stable compared to
 exams dating back to ___.  There appears to be interval increase in
 the opacification over the right lung suggestive of a slight increase in
 extent and severity of the right pleural effusion. There is worsening of a
 left lower lung atelectasis.  The left pleural effusion is unchanged.  The
 degree of pulmonary edema is constant.  There is no evidence of a
 pneumothorax.  Massively enlarged triangular cardiac silhouette is again
 suggestive of a pericardial effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Interval worsening of opacification over the right lung suggestive of an
 increase in the extent and severity of the right pleural effusion.
 
 2. Increase in consolidation at the left lung base, likely secondary to
 atelectasis, however infection cannot be excluded.
