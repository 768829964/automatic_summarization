 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic hydropneumothorax, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant change is seen.
 The partly linear, partly cyst-like lesions at the right lung bases are
 minimally decreased as compared to the previous exam.  Otherwise, the right
 and the left lung appear unchanged.  The appearance of the cardiac silhouette
 is also unchanged.  No new parenchymal opacities.  Signs of mild fluid
 overload persist.
