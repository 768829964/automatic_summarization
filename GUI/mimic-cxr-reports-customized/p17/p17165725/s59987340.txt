                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess right chest catheter.  Comparison is made with prior
 study performed three hours earlier.
 
 Right basal catheter is not kinked.  There is increase in opacity in the right
 lower lobe consistent with increasing pleural effusion and adjacent
 consolidation.  Left lower lobe opacities have increased consistent with
 increasing atelectasis.  There are no other interval changes.
