                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest x-ray semi-upright
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/history of lung CA, s/p left VATS and LUL wedge resection
 in ___, right VATS w/RUL wedge resection in ___, found to have residual
 cancer at staple line, now s/p right-sided thoracotomy with RUL resection on
 ___ with significant intra-operative blood loss. Prolonged and complicated
 ICU course.  // interval eval
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Compared to prior chest x-rays dated back to ___
 with Neulasta of of ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The monitoring and support devices are unchanged, as is the chronic area of
 increased opacification in the right mid zone.
 There is a curvilinear up opacification at the right base that was not
 previously seen with lucency below at.  Although this could represent an
 unusual type of atelectasis, when accompanied with the relatively lucent
 opacification of soft tissues in the abdomen is worrisome for
 pneumoperitoneum.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Repeat chest radiograph in the early afternoon to determine whether the
 findings suspicious of pneumoperitoneum are still present.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):   This information has been discussed with Dr. ___, ___
 was covering for Dr. ___.  He relates that the patient is doing well with no
 evidence of abdominal complaints or recent abdominal surgery or
 instrumentation.  Consequently, he will water a a repeat chest radiograph in
 the early afternoon.  If there is been a change in appearance of the right
 base, pneumoperitoneum can't be excluded.  If there is a similar appearance,
 the lateral decubitus view with horizontal beam will be obtained to determine
 whether there is movable free air in the abdomen.  At that time, decision will
 be made whether or not to water a CT scan.
