 AP CHEST, 5:57 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Chest tube recently removed, evaluate possible pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 10:53 a.m.:
 
 Lower lung volumes are even smaller today than earlier in the day.  Moderate
 left pneumothorax has not increased.  The pleural effusion on the left is
 small if any.  Greater opacification at the left lung base is probably
 atelectasis.  Mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement are
 exaggerated by low lung volume.  Subcutaneous emphysema persists in the left
 chest wall and the neck.
