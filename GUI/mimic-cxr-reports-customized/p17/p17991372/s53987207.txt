                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with RB-ILD with acute on chronic hypoxemic resp
 failure  // interval monitoring pleural effusions, infiltrates      interval
 monitoring pleural effusions, infiltrates
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the nasogastric tube appears to
 have been removed.  Other monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
 Continued low lung volumes with mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and
 diffuse bilateral pulmonary interstitial changes.  Again this could reflect
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure superimposed on the patient's known
 chronic interstitial lung disease.
 Has previously, given the extensive pulmonary changes, it would be extremely
 difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
