                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  VATS with left lower lobe biopsy, post-chest tube removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the left chest tube has been
 removed, and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacifications
 have increased, consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis accentuated
 in a patient with low lung volumes.  In the appropriate clinical setting, the
 possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
