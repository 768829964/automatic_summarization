                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with RB-ILD, respiratory failure, c/f new
 infection  // interval change      interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are stable.  Continued mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The
 diffuse bilateral interstitial changes appears slightly more prominent on the
 current study.  This could well represent some elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure superimposed on known chronic interstitial lung disease.
 In view of the extensive pulmonary involvement, it would be extremely
 difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
