 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 5:55 PM
  No pneumothorax, new right chest tube in place.  There is still a significant
  right pleural effusion densely layering and compressing the right lower lobe. 
  Increased heterogeneous opacity in the lingula may represent atelectasis but
  aspiration should be suspected in the right clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right thoracentesis, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been removal of a
 substantial amount of fluid from the right pleural space with a catheter
 remaining in place.  A substantial residual opacification at the right base is
 consistent with fluid and continued collapse of the right lower lobe.
 
 No evidence of pneumothorax.
