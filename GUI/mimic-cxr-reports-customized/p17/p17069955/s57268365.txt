                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with MDS status ___ MUD stem cell transplant,
 respiratory failure secondary to influenza/VAP.  Evaluate endotracheal tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to multiple prior chest radiographs, most
 recently dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is well positioned, terminating 3.7 cm above the
 carina.  Left-sided central venous catheter does not cross midline and is
 likely within the distal aspect of the left brachiocephalic vein.  Enteric
 catheter courses below left hemidiaphragm and out of view.  There is mildly
 increased bibasilar opacifications, left greater than right, which may reflect
 worsening pneumonia; however, there is also increased mild background
 pulmonary edema.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Malpositioned endotracheal tube.  Increased density of bibasilar
 opacifications, left greater than right, possibly reflecting worsening
 pneumonia vs. increased edema.
