                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New NG tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___ and ___. 
 CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: An enteric tube has been exchanged in the interim and while the tip
 terminates in the stomach, the side port is superior to the gastroesophageal
 junction.  A right-sided PICC terminates in the distal SVC.
 
 The lung volumes are low which results in vascular crowding.  There is
 unchanged mild cardiomegaly.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 There is new right upper lobe volume loss consistent with atelectasis. 
 Prominence of the mediastinum is stable in appearance is secondary to no new
 mediastinal lipomatosis.  Old right rib fractures are again noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. New enteric tube with side port terminating above the GE junction. 
 Advancement by 10 cm is recommended for better positioning.  
 2. New right upper lobe atelectasis.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 11:22 AM on
