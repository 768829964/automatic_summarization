 HISTORY:  Status post transplant with pneumonia.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A frontal semi upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  The

 expected course although the tip is not visualized.  The left internal jugular
 catheter ends at the brachiocephalic SVC confluence.  Left basilar pneumonia
 is slightly improved.  Right basilar atelectasis persists.  No pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: Slight improvement in left lower lobe pneumonia.
