 study and the patient has been extubated.  There has been significant improved
 months in aeration of the bilateral lung bases with minimal residual right
 basilar atelectasis.  No pleural effusion seen.  No definite consolidation
 seen.  Mild prominence of the right hilum is likely in part due to
 positioning.
