 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of right pleural catheter with near resolution
 of right pleural effusion and development of a small right apical
 pneumothorax.  Swan-Ganz catheter and left PICC are in standard position, and
 a feeding tube has been removed.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in
 appearance.  Slight improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion with decrease
 in extent of interstitial edema.  Unchanged left retrocardiac opacity, but
 improving atelectasis at the right lung base following evacuation of pleural
 fluid.
