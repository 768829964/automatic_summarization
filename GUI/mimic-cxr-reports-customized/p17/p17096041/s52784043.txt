                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with RLL consolidation, fever  // Interval
 change?      Interval change?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a much
 better inspiration.  The left hemidiaphragm is now sharply seen and there is
 no evidence of appreciable pleural effusion or atelectasis.  Cardiac
 silhouette is stable.  There is no definite pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 There is continued opacification at the right base, though the hemidiaphragm
 is better seen.  This could represent some improving pleural effusion or
 merely be a manifestation of a more erect position of the patient.
 In view of the extensive pulmonary changes at the right base, the possibility
 of superimposed pneumonia is impossible to exclude, especially in the absence
 of a lateral view.
 Monitoring and support devices are stable.
