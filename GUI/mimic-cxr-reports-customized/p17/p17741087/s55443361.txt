                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage and left MCA stroke.  Evaluate for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Ultrasound ___ through ___.
 
 FRONTAL SEMI UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST:  The patient has been extubated. 
 Nasoenteric tube ends in the stomach.  Left PICC has been slightly retracted,
 now ending at the origin of the SVC.  
 
 Lung volumes are lower than on the prior study.  Left pleural effusion and
 adjacent atelectasis is similar to prior with a new right pleural effusion and
 atelectasis. Mild pulmonary edema has worsened. Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable allowing for lower lung volumes. No pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION: Worsening pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.
