                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:16 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with CVA, likely aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Continued severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette now accompanied by
 marked vascular engorgement suggests cardiac decompensation, leading to mild
 pulmonary edema and increasing moderate bilateral pleural effusions. 
 Aspiration and/or pneumonia cannot be excluded but need not be invoked to
 explain the radiographic findings.  ET tube in standard placement, feeding
 tube ends in the stomach, right PIC line can be traced as far as the origin of
 the SVC.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged when the findings were recognized, at 10 a.m., but did not
 respond. Findings were reported by telephone to another house officer at 11
 a.m.
