                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with intracranial hemorrhage and  respiratory
 failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  An endotracheal tube is low
 within the trachea, 1.1 cm from the carina, and pointing towards the right
 main stem bronchus.  Repositioning by at least 2 cm is recommended.  An
 enteric catheter is at least below the diaphragm though the tip is
 incompletely imaged.  Bibasilar opacities have increased in the interval and
 may be due to increasing pleural fluid as there is also increased pulmonary
 vascular congestion and edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  Enlargement of the
 bilateral hila is likely secondary to vascular engorgement.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increasing bilateral pleural effusions and new moderate pulmonary edema.
 2.  Malpositioned endotracheal tube, 1 cm from the carina.  Proximal
 repositioning recommended.
 
 Malposition of the endotracheal tube communicated to Dr. ___ at 11:33
 a.m. on ___ by telephone, two minutes after discovery.
