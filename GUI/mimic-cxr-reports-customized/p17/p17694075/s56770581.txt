                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Decrease in saturations in a patient after aortic
 valve replacement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip, the Dobbhoff tube, the Swan-Ganz catheter, the replaced
 valve, left chest tube are in unchanged position.  Left retrocardiac
 atelectasis, mediastinal contours and cardiac silhouette are unchanged.  No
 interval development of pulmonary edema is seen.
 
 Overall, no substantial changes to explain decrease in patient's saturations
 are present.  If clinically warranted, evaluation with chest CT to exclude the
 possibility of pulmonary embolism might be considered.
