 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old woman with a recently placed right subclavian
 central line, please evaluate central line.

 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. There has been interval
 placement of a right chest central line whose distal tip projects over the
 lower SVC. The bilateral hila are normal. The left basilar opacity obscuring
 the left hemidiaphragm is unchanged, consistent with a layering left pleural
 effusion as seen on prior exams. There are no new focal lung consolidations.
 There is no evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion. There is no
 pneumothorax.

 Interval placement of right chest central line with distal tip projecting over
