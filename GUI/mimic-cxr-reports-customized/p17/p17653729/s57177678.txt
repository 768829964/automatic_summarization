                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with sepsis, respiratory failure, now s/p
 intubation  // ET placement      ET placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___
 and ___, 5:25.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of the new endotracheal tube is at the thoracic inlet, 4.5 cm above the
 carina in standard placement.
 
 Borderline interstitial edema seen earlier has improved as lung volumes have
 increased.  Consolidation developing in the right lower lobe, and worsening in
 the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe is probably aspiration
 pneumonia. Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed, left greater than
 right, but not substantial. Heart size is normal.
 
 Right subclavian line ends in the low SVC.  No pneumothorax.
