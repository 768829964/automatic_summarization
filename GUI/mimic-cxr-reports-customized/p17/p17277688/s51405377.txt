                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p cardiac arrest with trouble managing
 secretions  // pulm edema vs. new opacificaiton
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 18:16
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.  Right IJ central line is again seen, with tip
 in the region of the cavoatrial junction.  The difference in position of the
 line in relation to the cardiac silhouette is likely accounted for by
 rotation.  An NG type 2 with radiopaque tip is now present, with tip beneath
 the diaphragm, overlying the stomach.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are slightly low.  Allowing for this, diffuse patchy
 opacities are again seen throughout both lungs, overall similar in appearance.
 Also again seen is increased retrocardiac density, compatible left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.  No effusion or pneumothorax detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A new orogastric tube is present-- radiopaque tip overlies the stomach.
 
 Diffuse bilateral opacities and retrocardiac opacity are overall similar to ___.
