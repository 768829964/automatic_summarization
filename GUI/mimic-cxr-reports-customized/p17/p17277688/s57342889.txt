 Enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Moderate pulmonary
 edema has minimally increased.  Bibasilar opacities are worse in the left
 lower lobe a combination of atelectasis and pulmonary edema. I suspect there
 is a small left pleural effusion.  LVAD, other chest lines and tubes are in
 unchanged standard position.
