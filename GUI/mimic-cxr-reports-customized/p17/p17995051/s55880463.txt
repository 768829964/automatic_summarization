                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man found to have large right MCA/ACA stroke.
 mechanically ventilated.  //    r/o acute cardiopulmonary process        r/o
 acute cardiopulmonary process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is again increased
 opacification at the bases with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms.  This
 appearance appears to be less prominent on the right, but better seen on the
 left.  Although the these findings could merely reflect atelectasis, in the
 appropriate clinical setting superimposed pneumonia would have to be seriously
 considered, especially on the left.
