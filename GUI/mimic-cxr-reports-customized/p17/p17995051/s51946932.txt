 Compared to ___ chest radiograph, tip of endotracheal tube is now
 6.8 cm above the carina and could be advanced slightly for standard
 positioning.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Worsening bibasilar
 patchy and linear opacities favor atelectasis, but coexisting aspiration and
 infectious pneumonia are possible in the appropriate clinical settings.
