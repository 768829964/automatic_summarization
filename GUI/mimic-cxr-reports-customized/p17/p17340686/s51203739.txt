                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fever of unknown origin and recent pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral chest radiograph.  2 views.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A dual lumen left subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the right
 atrium unchanged from prior exam.  The heart size is stably enlarged. 
 Vascular calcifications are seen along the aortic arch.  There is perihilar
 and basilar prominence of the pulmonary vasculature compatible with fluid
 overload.  Mild interstitial abnormalities are unchanged from prior exam. 
 There is blunting of the bilateral posterior costovertebral angles likely
 representing a very small effusions.  Patchy consolidations in the right
 middle lobe may represent pneumonia in the right clinical circumstances.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right middle lobe patchy consolidation which could reflect infectious
 process.
 
 2. Perihilar and basilar vascular prominence compatible with fluid overload.
