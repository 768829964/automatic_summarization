  1.  Increased right perihilar opacities.  Differential diagnosis includes
  dilated pulmonary vessels, infection, or lymphadenopathy.  Malignancy is not
  excluded.  A followup CT of the chest in ___ weeks following an appropriate
  course of therapy is recommended to confirm resolution.  
  
  2.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion/ edema with increased opacity at the
  bilateral lung bases possibly reflecting dependent edema.  No large pleural
  effusion. 
  
  3.  No widening of the mediastinum.  Stable cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest pain radiating to the back, here to evaluate for evidence
 of aortic dissection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent but stable.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged with prior coronary stenting noted. 
 Calcification at the aortic knob is unchanged.  A large bore left-sided
 central venous catheter is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in
 the right atrium.  The pulmonary vasculature is prominent with mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema, slightly improved from ___.  There is
 increased right perihilar opacification from the most recent prior study also
 likely due to pulmonary edema.  Streaky opacities at the bilateral lung bases
 most likely reflect atelectasis; however, superimposed infection is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical context.  There is a small right pleural
 effusion. No pneumothorax detected.  Radiopaque densities projecting over the
 left lateral lung base are likely external to the patient.  There is no
 evidence of free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild pulmonary edema.  Increased opacification at the bilateral lung bases
 may be related in part to dependent pulmonary edema and atelectasis.
 2.  No widening of the mediastinum.  Stable cardiomegaly.
