                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Chest pain, dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Double-lumen
 left-sided dialysis catheter is seen terminating in the right atrium, stable
 in position.  There is stable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  The
 aortic knob remains calcified.  There is prominence of the pulmonary
 vasculature, similar to prior.  There may be small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The lateral view is suboptimal due to patient's overlying arm and
 a posterior lung consolidation is not excluded.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
