                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with fall.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to multiple prior exams including most recent radiograph of
 the chest from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The lateral view
 is suboptimal due to overlying soft tissues due to patient's inability to move
 right arm, secondary to chronic right humeral head deformity and severe
 osteoarthritis of the right glenohumeral joint.
 
 A left port-a-cath is again seen, terminating at the cavoatrial junction.  The
 heart is moderately enlarged, as before.  The lung volumes are low, and there
 is mild fluid overload with small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
 pneumothorax or focal consolidation concerning for pneumonia.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Moderate cardiomegaly with mild fluid overload and small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  No definite evidence of pneumonia.
 2. Chronic deformity of the right humeral head with severe osteoarthritis of
 the right glenohumeral joint.
