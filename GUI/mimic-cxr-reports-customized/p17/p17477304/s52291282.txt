                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of lethargy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Left-sided
 large bore central venous catheter terminates in the deep right atrium,
 without significant interval change.  There is eventration of the right
 hemidiaphragm. Since the prior study, there has been development of a patchy
 opacity at the right mid-to-lower lung which could be due to infection or
 aspiration.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Chronic
 deformity at the distal right clavicle is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe opacity worrisome for pneumonia.  Recommend
 followup to resolution.
