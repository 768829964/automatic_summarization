                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is at the upper limits of normal size. The mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  Each hilum moderate shows perhaps minimal congestion and upper
 zone vessels appear plump although well-defined in contours.  A very mild
 interstitial prominence is discernible in the lower lungs.  There is suspicion
 for very small pleural effusions, probably bilateral. Mild new elevation of
 the left hemidiaphragm is accompanied by streaky opacities suggesting minor
 atelectasis. Sclerotic endplate changes along the thoracic spine suggest renal
 osteodystrophy, present before.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings suggesting mild pulmonary venous hypertension but without clear
 pulmonary edema; much less severe than findings seen on the prior radiographs.
