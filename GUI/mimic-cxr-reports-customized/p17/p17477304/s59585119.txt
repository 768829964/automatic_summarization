                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with new L IJ  // central line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates slight interval
 increase in the degree of pulmonary edema, which is moderate. There are
 persistent bibasilar opacities come which may represent a combination of
 pleural fluid and compressive atelectasis. The patient is status post interval
 placement of a left-sided internal jugular central venous line, which ends in
 the upper SVC. No pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  Increased sclerosis of the visualized osseous structures likely
 relates to end-stage renal disease.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left-sided internal jugular central venous line ends in the upper SVC.
 
 2.  Slight interval worsening of pulmonary edema.
 
 3.  Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.
