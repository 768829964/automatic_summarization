 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with DAH, ILD, s/p PEA arrest, intubated  // eval
 for interval change      eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 05:16
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 04:36 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube, endotracheal tube and right internal jugular central line
 unchanged in position.  Overall cardiac mediastinal contours are stable given
 differences in patient positioning.  Bilateral parenchymal opacities with a
 more consolidative appearance at the left base are likely not significantly
 changed given differences in technique between studies and are consistent with
 reported NSIP.  Pneumonia or aspiration at the left base cannot be excluded. 
 There is residual right chest wall subcutaneous emphysema.  No obvious
 pneumothorax.
