                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, to assess for progression.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Monitoring and support devices remain in place.  Again, the left
 hemidiaphragm is poorly seen, consistent with a small pleural effusion and
 basilar atelectasis.  The left hemidiaphragm is more sharply visualized,
 though there are still some atelectatic changes in the left lower lobe.
 
 Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.
