                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Brain injury, intubated patient.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly is stable.  ET tube is in standard position.  NG tube tip is
 out of view below the diaphragm.  Large bilateral pleural effusions with
 associated atelectasis are likely unchanged, allowing the difference in
 positioning of the patient.
