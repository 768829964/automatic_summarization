 seen overlying the right upper quadrant.  A left subclavian PICC line is
 unchanged in position. The endotracheal tube continues to have its tip
 approximately 5 cm above the carina.  There is stable retrocardiac
 consolidation with associated effusion likely reflecting partial lower lobe
 atelectasis.  There has been some improvement in the mild pulmonary and
 interstitial edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The heart remains enlarged.
