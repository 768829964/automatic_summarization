                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Obesity, hypoventilation, status post tracheostomy, here to
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 09:43.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right PICC has been retracted with the tip terminating in the
 low SVC.  A tracheostomy tube is in place with the tip projecting over the
 trachea although the internal portion appears horizontal.  The inspiratory
 lung volumes remain very low.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and the
 mediastinal contours are stably widened.  There is persistent pulmonary
 vascular engorgement with mild pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac opacification in
 the setting of low lung volumes most likely reflects moderate atelectasis. 
 The right costophrenic angle is clear.  The left costophrenic angle is blunted
 and may represent a small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right PICC retracted with tip in low SVC.
 2.  Horizontal internal portion of tracheostomy tube may be positional. 
 Please correlate clinically.
 2.  Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema.
