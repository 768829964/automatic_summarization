                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and chest pain.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained with the patient in a
 semi upright position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There are diffuse bilateral dense alveolar opacities.  Evaluation of the lung
 bases is limited by overlying soft tissue and low lung volumes.  Heart size
 appears enlarged, possibly in part exaggerated by AP technique and low lung
 volumes.  Compared to prior exam, the mediastinum appears widened.  No
 pneumothorax is detected on this view.  Small bilateral pleural effusions may
 be present although evaluation is difficult due to overlying soft tissue.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities.  Differential diagnosis includes
 infection, edema, and ARDS.
 
 2.  New mediastinal widening.  If clinically feasible, further evaluation with
 CT is recommended.  If not clinically feasible, close follow up radiography
 and clinical correlation is recommended.
 
 Findings and recommendations were discussed with ___ by
 ___ by telephone at 12:08 p.m. on ___ at the time of
 discovery of these findings.
