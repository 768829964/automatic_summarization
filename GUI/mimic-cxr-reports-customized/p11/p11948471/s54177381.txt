                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of a tension pneumothorax, status post chest tube
 placement.  Evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP semi-upright view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in unchanged position 5.3 cm from the
 carina.  A thinner catheter terminates in the right mainstem bronchus.  After
 discussion with the team, this is purposeful, and a specialized catheter with
 a valve placed by the interventional pulmonologists.  A right internal jugular
 catheter is unchanged with the tip in the mid SVC.
 
 Again, there is a small right apical pneumothorax, unchanged from the prior
 exam.  There is a pigtail catheter in unchanged position, overlying the mid
 right hemithorax.  There is no left pneumothorax.  Opacification at the right
 base is stable.  There is no new opacity.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged right apical pneumothorax, right basilar consolidation,
 and small bilateral pleural effusions.
