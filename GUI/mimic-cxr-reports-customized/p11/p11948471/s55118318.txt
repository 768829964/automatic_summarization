                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Followup pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Outside hospital chest CT
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The loculated right anterior hydropneumothorax seen on the CT from ___ is difficult to appreciate on this single upright frontal radiograph.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are not significantly changed compared to
 the most recent radiograph from ___. Round opacities measuring up to
 4.8 cm project over the right lung base, not significantly changed. There is
 severe emphysema. Left basilar atelectasis is minimal. The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are normal. A left PICC ends in the upper aspect of the
 right atrium, unchanged. The tracheostomy tube is appropriately positioned.
 Right-sided endobronchial stents are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Known right anterior loculated hydropneumothorax is difficult to assess on
 this radiograph. Lateral radiographs would be better suited for any further
 followup.
 2. Unchanged small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3. Unchanged right lower lobe round opacities measuring up to to 4.8 cm,
 likely abscesses.
