                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hx of COPD, HTN, pAfib presenting with
 worsening cough, SOB, found to be cyanotic and unresponsive, presenting with
 hypoxemic respiratory failure  // evaluate pulmonary infiltrates and
 consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, bilateral asymmetrically
 distributed alveolar opacities have improved on the left and worsened on the
 right.  They likely represent a combination of pulmonary edema and infectious
 pneumonia.  Pulmonary hemorrhage is an additional consideration in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
