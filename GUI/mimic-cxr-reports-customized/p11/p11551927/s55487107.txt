                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new dobhoff  // eval dobhoff placement
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the Dobbhoff catheter was inserted.
 While the first image shows the Dobbhoff catheter malpositioned in the right
 bronchial system, the second image documents the tip of the Dobbhoff catheter
 projecting over the stomach. The catheter, however, could be advanced by
 approximately 5 cm to be securely positioned in the middle parts of the
 stomach.
 No complications, notably no pneumothorax. The right subclavian catheter and
 the tracheostomy tube are unchanged.  No pneumothorax.
