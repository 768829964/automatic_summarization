                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.  The patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Tracheostomy tube tip terminates approximately 4.7 cm from the carina. 
 Partially imaged is a catheter within the midline upper abdomen.  The heart
 size is normal.  Widening of the left superior mediastinal contour is noted,
 with slight rightward deviation of the trachea.  There is mild pulmonary
 edema.  Lung volumes are low.  More focal opacities are noted within the
 periphery of the right mid and lower lung field as well as left lung base.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Standard position of the tracheostomy tube.
 
 2. Mild pulmonary edema.
 
 3. More focal peripheral opacities within the right mid and lower lung field
 as well as the left lung base.  Findings could reflect areas of infection, and
 followup radiographs after diuresis are recommended.
 
 4. Left superior mediastinal widening with mild rightward shift of the
 trachea.  Findings could potentially due to enlarged left thyroid goiter, but
 other mass lesion is not excluded and further assessment with CT is suggested.
