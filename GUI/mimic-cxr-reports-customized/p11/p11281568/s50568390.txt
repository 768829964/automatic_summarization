                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position.
 Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 markings.  With this limitation in mind, widespread ground-glass and reticular
 opacities are relatively similar to the prior chest x-ray and have been
 documented on older chest CT of ___.  Given apparent chronicity
 of an HIV status, chronic PCP should be considered.  A more confluent area of
 opacity in the left infrahilar region has increased compared to the recent
 radiograph, and raises the possibility of a superimposed bacterial pneumonia
 in the appropriate clinical setting.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or
 substantial pleural effusion.
