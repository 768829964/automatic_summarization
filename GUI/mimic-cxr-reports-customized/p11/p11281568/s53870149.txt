 INDICATION:  PNEUMONIA.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are diffuse background increased interstitial markings consistent with
 known interstitial lung disease.  This appears similar compared to the prior
 examination.  A tracheostomy tube is noted. The heart is enlarged. There is no
 pneumothorax or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar appearance of the lungs with diffusely increased interstitial markings
 reflecting chronic interstitial lung disease. A superimposed pneumonia would
 be difficult to exclude.
