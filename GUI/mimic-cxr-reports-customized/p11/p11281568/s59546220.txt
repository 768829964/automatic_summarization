                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M with chronic trach, p/w leukocytosis, increased sputum
 production, evaluate for consolidation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with direct comparison made to
 study from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position.  The lungs are unchanged in
 appearance with low lung volumes and widespread bilateral hazy opacities which
 likely represents a mild degree of pulmonary edema superimposed on background
 chronic interstitial lung disease.  The cardiac silhouette is unchanged. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral hazy opacities compatible with a combination of severe
 background interstitial lung disease and a mild degree of pulmonary edema.  No
 focal consolidation.  No significant interval change when compared to the
 prior study.
