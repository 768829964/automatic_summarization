                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with fever, tachycardia, has tracheostomy, recent
 G/J tube replacement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___, CT torso ___, and chest
 radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube tip is in unchanged position. Lung volumes are low. Heart
 size is normal. Mediastinal contour is unchanged. Hilar contours are similar.
 Increased interstitial markings are noted diffusely throughout the right lung,
 and within the lower lung field on the left. No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified. No acute osseous abnormalities seen. No
 subdiaphragmatic free air is demonstrated. Partially imaged is a
 gastrojejunostomy catheter within the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Increased interstitial markings, more pronounced on the right. Findings may
 reflect superimposed asymmetric pulmonary edema on a background of chronic
 interstitial lung disease.  Follow up radiographs after diuresis are
 recommended.
 2. No subdiaphragmatic free air.
