                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:39 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with subarachnoid hemorrhage and new Dobbhoff tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Two frontal views of the chest, the first excluding the right
 lower chest, the second showing the entire chest, both show a feeding tube
 cannulating the right bronchial tree to the periphery.  Curvature of the tube
 tip raises the possibility of pleural perforation, although there is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion, and a followup radiograph, obtained one hour
 later showed no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The findings on this study
 were reported by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ at 6:10 p.m., immediately after
 discovery.
 
 Lungs are clear, cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are normal.  No
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  ET tube in standard placement.
