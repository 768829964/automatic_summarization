                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation and multiple bronchoscopies for mucus obstruction.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is slightly better
 inspiration.  The left hemidiaphragm is not sharply seen and there is hazy
 opacification at the left base.  This suggests a possible atelectasis and
 effusion.  
 
 Monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
