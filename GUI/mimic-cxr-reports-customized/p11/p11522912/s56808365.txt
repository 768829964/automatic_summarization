 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:04 PM
  New wedge-shaped along the medial aspect of the right lower lung with
  depression of right hila suggest right middle lobe collapse.  Increased left
  lower lobe opacification likely represents combination of worsening effusion
  and atelectasis though superimposed infectious process is not excluded. 
  Tracheostomy tube appears well positioned.  Visualized aspects of the
  mediastinum are unremarkable.  Cardiac silhouette is obscured.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Newly placed tracheostomy, shortness of breath, rule out
 pathological changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a new wedge-shaped opacity along the medial aspect of the
 right lower lobe, with depression of the right hilus, suggesting right middle
 lobe collapse.  Increased left lower lobe opacity could represent a
 combination of worsening effusion and atelectasis, the tracheostomy tube is in
 unchanged position.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  No overt pulmonary
 edema.  A wet read was delivered at the time of image acquisition.
