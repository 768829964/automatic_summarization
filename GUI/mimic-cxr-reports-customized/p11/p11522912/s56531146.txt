                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with c5 quad with b/l lower lung collapse  //
 please eval for interval change
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:
 Chest radiographs and concurrent chest CTA when available, ___
 through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Previous dependent consolidation in the right lung has cleared so
 substantially since ___ that the bulk of it was probably pulmonary
 edema, although some contribution from aspiration may well have been present. 
 The left lower lobe remains entirely airless, presumably collapsed, though
 pneumonia is not excluded.  The severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 is a long-standing finding, exaggerated by a large mediastinal fat collection.
 Pleural effusion is small on the left if any.  Vascular congestion in the
 upper lungs reflects cardiac dysfunction.
 Left PIC line ends in the low SVC.  Mild narrowing of the trachea at the
 thoracic inlet is most commonly due to prior tracheostomy.
