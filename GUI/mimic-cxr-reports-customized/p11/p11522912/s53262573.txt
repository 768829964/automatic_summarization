 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 6:15
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with mucous plugging, assess for interval
 change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 3:59.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 6:15 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position.  Left subclavian PICC
 line and nasogastric tube are unchanged in position.  There are layering
 bilateral effusions with bibasilar airspace opacities, most likely reflecting
 compressive atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be excluded.  The
 vasculature is cephalized consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension, but
 no pulmonary edema is evident.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.
