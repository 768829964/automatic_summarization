                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest CT from ___ as well as a chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with quadriplegia, presenting with altered
 mental status, assess for signs of pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were provided.  A left
 upper extremity PICC line is seen with its tip extending to the upper SVC
 region.  The previously noted tracheostomy is no longer visualized.  There is
 improved aeration at the right and left lung base without definite signs of
 pleural effusion.  Mild bibasilar atelectasis is noted.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette appears grossly stable with mild cardiomegaly noted.  Lung bases
 are somewhat limited in overall evaluation due to overlap with overlying soft
 tissues on the frontal projection.  No definite retrocardiac consolidation is
 seen in the lateral projection, though evaluation is somewhat limited.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild cardiomegaly.  Probable bibasilar atelectasis with interval
 resolution of bilateral pleural effusions.  PICC line tip in the upper SVC.
