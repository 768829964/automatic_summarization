                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with quadriplegia with worsening dyspnea and
 somewhat decreased BS on the L // eval for PNA or collapse
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest raiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP view of the chest provided.
 
 There is near total opacification of the left lung, with residual right upper
 lobe aeration. There is no contralateral shift of mediastinal structures.
 Altogether, these findings are concerning for partially collapsed left lung
 that is most likely due to mucus plugging. There is additional moderate amount
 of layering pleural effusion on the left.
 
 Compared to prior study, the right juxta-hilar region opacity appears much
 worse, likely reflective of atelectasis however aspiration pneumonia is also
 certainly a possibility. There is a small to moderate amount of pleural
 effusion on the right.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Partial left lung opacification, concerning for subtotal left lung collapse
 that is most likely due to mucus plugging.
 2. Worsen right juxta-hilar opacity, likely atelectasis however aspiration
 pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 3. Bilateral pleural effusions, left worse than right.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Preliminary findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 on the telephone on ___ at 9:4-PM, 2 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
