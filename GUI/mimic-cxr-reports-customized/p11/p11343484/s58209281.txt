 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:34.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous examination, there is no substantial
 change in position of the endotracheal tube.  The tip of the tube currently
 projects 6.6 cm above the carina and is located relatively high.  Advancement
 by 1-2 cm appears possible.  Better delineated than on the previous
 examination are the multiple pleural calcifications.  The left medial
 component of these calcifications mimics the presence of a pneumothorax (no
 pneumothorax is clearly visible on the present examination).
 
 Unchanged distribution and extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities. 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.
