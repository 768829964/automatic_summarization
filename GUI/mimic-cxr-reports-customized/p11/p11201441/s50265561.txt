                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:20 AM ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Fall from ladder.  Mediastinal hematoma, pulmonary contusion, and
 pneumothorax.  Ventilator-associated pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Tracheostomy tube ends in standard position.  Right subclavian line ends near
 just beyond the estimated location of the superior cavoatrial junction.  Large
 gas collection in the upper abdomen could be free pneumoperitoneum.  Large
 right pleural effusion has increased since ___.  Moderate left pleural
 effusion stable.  Lung bases are obscured by overlying abnormality; whether
 pneumonia or atelectasis is present is radiographically indeterminate, but
 vascular congestion is seen in the left upper lung.  The heart is probably
 unchanged in standard size.  No definite pneumothorax.  I discussed findings
 with house officer caring for this person at the time of dictation.
