 AP CHEST, 8:32 A.M., ___   
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with COPD and worsening dyspnea.  Question heart
 failure or pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Previous left apical consolidation and perihilar opacification in the left
 lung has improved, and now there is generalized opacification on the right. 
 The sequence of events suggests asymmetric pulmonary edema dependent on
 patient position.  Heart is moderately enlarged but unchanged.  Right
 hemidiaphragm is chronically elevated.  Small right pleural effusion is seen
 best at the apex of the hemithorax.  Left pleural effusion is small if any. 
 No pneumothorax.
