                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Study is limited due to patient rotation.  Heart size is normal.  The aortic
 knob is calcified.  There is no overt pulmonary edema, but crowding of
 bronchovascular structures is noted.  Linear and ill-defined opacities within
 the left upper and mid lung fields are re- demonstrated, better assessed on
 the recent chest CT, and may reflect residual inflammation or infection.
 Postsurgical changes of the right lung with evidence of volume loss with
 tenting of the right hemidiaphragm and linear opacities in the right upper
 lung field compatible with prior radiation fibrosis are re- demonstrated.  No
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Bilateral
 shoulder arthroplasties are visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited exam.  Postsurgical and post treatment changes in the right lung,
 similar compared to the prior exam.  Linear and ill-defined in opacities in
 the left upper and mid lung fields are re- demonstrated, likely the residua of
 prior infection or inflammation.
