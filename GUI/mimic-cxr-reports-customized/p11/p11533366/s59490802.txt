                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Green productive sputum.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and chest CTA.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged, with the heart size
 within normal limits.  The aortic knob remains calcified.  The pulmonary
 vascularity is not engorged.  Linear opacities in both upper lobes reflect
 areas of scarring as demonstrated on the prior CT.  No new focal areas of
 consolidation are present.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized.
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Left humeral head prosthesis is
 partially imaged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No new areas of consolidation to suggest pneumonia.  Bilateral
 upper lobe linear opacities compatible with areas of scarring.
