                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ___F found unresponsive with seizure
 activity (left sided convulsions and left head/gaze deviation), with acute on
 chronic bilateral frontal and parietal lobe infarcts intubated w/ concern for
 takotsubos and resolving rhabdomyolysis with aggressive fluid resuscitation.
 Continues with poor neuro exam.  // interval change  interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, there are even lower lung volumes. 
 The monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.  Continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with minimal elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure.
 Retrocardiac opacification is again seen with partial silhouetting of the
 hemidiaphragm.  Although much of this probably represents volume loss in the
 left lower lobe, in the appropriate clinical setting superimposed aspiration
 or infectious pneumonia would have to be considered.
