                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with aspiration and concern for pneumonia.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:  The endotracheal tube sits 3.5 cm above the carina.  A
 left-sided central line tip terminates in the mid SVC.  Nasogastric tube
 courses inferiorly and out of field-of-view.  The right costophrenic angle has
 been excluded from the exam.  The heart size continues to be large, but the
 mediastinal contours have not changed.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions
 with underlying atelectasis are present.  Perihilar opacities additionally
 suggest a degree of edema.  The extent of pulmonary opacities has not changed
 significantly since prior exam.  There is no pneumothorax.
