 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:26 PM
  Interval intubation with endotracheal tube tip at the orifice of the right
  mainstem bronchus. Retraction is recommended. Esophageal catheter with tip
  projecting over left upper quadrant, likely within the stomach. New bilateral
  alveolar opacities, most likely representing acute edema with new small
  bilateral pleural effusions. Low lung volumes. Findings discussed with Dr.
  ___ by phone at 8:26 p.m. on ___ at time of discovery of these
  findings.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:24 P.M. ON ___
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 4:16 p.m.
 
 Nasogastric tube has been repositioned from the right lower lobe bronchus to
 the stomach.  Widespread pulmonary opacification is more likely asymmetric
 edema than aspiration alone, though there may be some component of aspiration,
 even pneumonia.  Small pleural effusions are presumed.  No pneumothorax.  Tip
 of the endotracheal tube is approximately a centimeter above the carina and
 should be withdrawn 3 cm for standard placement.  No pneumothorax.  Gaseous
 distention of stomach has resolved, and improved in the remainder of the
 intestinal tract seen in the upper abdomen.
