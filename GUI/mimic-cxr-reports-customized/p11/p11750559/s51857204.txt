                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p hernia/bowel resection, being diuresed  //
 ?interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 411
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.  NG tube present, tip overlying gastric fundus.  The
 gastric fundus itself is distended and there is elevation the left
 hemidiaphragm.  A right PICC line is present, tip in the region of the SVC/RA
 junction.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 Compared to the prior study, there improved aeration in the left upper zone,
 though as noted, the left hemidiaphragm is quite elevated, obscuring the
 remainder of the lung.  The presence of a left-sided effusion is suspected.
 The mediastinal contours and precise position of the mediastinum are not
 effectively evaluated. The right hemidiaphragm is obscured and there is likely
 a right pleural effusion with some degree of right base underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.  However, the right upper and mid zones are grossly
 clear.
 
 Doubt significant CHF -- previously seen vascular plethora has improved.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improved aeration of the left upper lung and improvement in CHF findings. 
 Otherwise, overall appearance is similar.
 A
 Ir seen overlying the left lower chest is thought to line a distended gastric
 fundus, not withstanding the presence of a NG tube there.  If clinically
 indicated, a lateral view could help to confirm that the air is in the gastric
 fundus.
