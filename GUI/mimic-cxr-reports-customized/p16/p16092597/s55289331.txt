                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M unrestrained driver, T-boned in MVC, intubated at scene with
 IVH, L frontal contusion, R inferior orbital wall fx, small b/l PTX, LUL
 collapse, posterior liver lac, and non-displaced acute fx of L glenoid, L
 humeral mid shaft fracture.  // interval cxr
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 18: ___ p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Tracheostomy tube again noted.  Right subclavian PICC line tip at SVC/RA
 junction, slightly more distal than on the prior film.
 
 Compared to the prior study, the biapical pneumothoraces are both slightly
 smaller, with residua small right apical and tiny left apical pneumothoraces.
 
 Mid zone opacities are again noted, but slightly fainter on today's exam.  In
 part, however, this difference likely relates to differences in technique. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  No effusions.
