                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Dyspnea and cough, on home O2.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There
 continues to be a large loculated left pleural effusion which may be increased
 in size since the prior study, given differences in patient positioning. 
 There is increase in left base opacity, likely combination of pleural effusion
 and atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  Right base
 opacity persists.  No right pleural effusion is seen.  There has been interval
 decrease in right upper lobe consolidation.  Left suprahilar opacity is again
 seen, which may relate to prior radiation.
