                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with COPD, history of aspergillosis presenting with
 worsening dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal contour remains enlarged, partially attributable to the
 presence of bilateral paramediastinal radiation fibrosis, and appears slightly
 enlarged compared to the prior chest radiograph. Small left pleural effusion
 which is partially loculated laterally is unchanged. Increased interstitial
 markings are again seen in both lung bases, present on the prior chest CT, and
 again may reflect mild pulmonary edema or lymphangitic spread. No new focal
 consolidation, right-sided pleural effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.
 Distal posterior mediastinal clips are re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly increased size of the cardiomediastinal contour compared to the prior
 chest radiograph, and could be due to the presence of an increased pericardial
 effusion. Unchanged appearance of small partially loculated left pleural
 effusion. Increased interstitial opacities in the lung bases are similar
 compared to the prior chest CT, and again may reflect mild fluid overload or
 lymphangitic spread of tumor.
