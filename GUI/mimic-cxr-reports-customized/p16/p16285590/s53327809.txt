                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left VATS, to assess chest tube position.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are two chest tubes in
 place on the left.  One loops at the bronchial level and has the tip medially
 at the region of the costophrenic junction.  The other extends superiorly with
 the tip lateral at the level of the transverse arch of the aorta.  No evidence
 of pneumothorax.  
 
 Pigtail catheters have been removed.  Bibasilar atelectatic change is seen,
 more prominent on the right, in the appropriate clinical setting, this could
 reflect a developing consolidation.  Atelectatic streaks are seen in the right
 mid zone.
