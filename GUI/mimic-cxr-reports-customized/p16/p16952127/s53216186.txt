                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with feeding tube  // feeding tube placement?    
 feeding tube placement?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is been placement of the
 nasogastric tube that extends to the upper stomach.  However, the side port is
 above the cavoatrial junction, and the tube should be pushed forward at least
 5-10 cm for more optimal positioning.
 The IABP has been repositioned so that the tip is approximately 4.4 cm top of
 the transverse arch of the aorta.  It could be pushed forward another 2 cm for
 more optimal positioning.
 Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, in conjunction with enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette, produces a pattern consistent with pulmonary edema. 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia
 could be considered.
