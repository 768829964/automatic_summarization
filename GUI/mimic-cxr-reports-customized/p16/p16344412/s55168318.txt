                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tracheal injury.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 4.6 cm above the carina with the cuff  appearing
 overinflated. There is extensive subcutaneous emphysema throughout the chest,
 including outlining the pectoralis muscles and within the neck. A small
 pneumothorax is seen at the base of the right lung.  Linear density along the
 lateral aspect of the right lung represents an underlying skin fold. The
 cardiac silhouette is normal. There is pneumomediastinum.  Coarse interstitial
 pulmonary markings are noted diffusely, with bronchiectasis and bronchial wall
 thickening.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests a trace
 effusion. Lungs are hyperinflated likely due to underlying COPD. Cardiac
 silhouette size is normal and there is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 4.6 cm above the carina, with the balloon
 appearing overinflated.
 
 2.  Small right basilar pneumothorax. 
 
 3.  Pneumomediastinum and extensive subcutaneous emphysema. CT of the chest is
 recommended to assess for site of tracheal injury.  
 
 4.  Small left pleural effusion.
