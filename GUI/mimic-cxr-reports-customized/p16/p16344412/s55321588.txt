                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with new infiltrates on ___.  Have these resolve
 with antibiotic therapy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___:
 
 Prior radiographs document chronic right middle lobe atelectasis, and episodes
 of pneumonia in different areas of the lungs.  Some of the heterogeneous
 opacification on ___ was due to pulmonary edema in the setting of
 severe emphysema, but could have been due also to concurrent pneumonia,
 particularly in the axillary region of the right mid lung.  This area has only
 partially cleared, and there is progressive heterogeneous opacification at the
 right apex, which may well represent another focus of pneumonia.  Triangular
 region of opacification in the lingula, has shown variable degrees of
 radiodensity, but has generally grown more coalescent since ___. 
 Given the multiplicity of pulmonary abnormalities, it would be reasonable to
 perform a chest CT scan to look for evidence of active processes other than
 simple pneumonia, including malignancy and tuberculosis.
 
 Small right pleural effusion is new, likely residual of previous heart
 failure, but conceivably inflammatory.  Heart size is normal.
