                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of COPD and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph available from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  The heart size is normal.  There is
 increased caliber of the central pulmonary vessels with new hazy bibasilar
 opacities likely reflecting mild interstitial edema versus an atypical
 infection.  The lungs are hyperinflated with upper lucencies most compatible
 with COPD.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild vascular prominence with bibasilar opacities that may
 reflect mild interstitial edema or atypical infection.
