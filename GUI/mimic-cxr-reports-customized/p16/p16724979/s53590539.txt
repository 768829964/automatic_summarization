                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post tracheobronchoplasty with chest pain
 and shortness of breath.  Assess for effusion and worsening edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ from earlier today.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right chest tube are in
 unchanged positions.  Since the previous examination, without interval
 operative procedure, massive interval increase in right lateral chest wall and
 anterior chest wall subcutaneous air accompanies a new small-to-moderate right
 pneumothorax inferiorly and laterally.  The cardiomediastinum is stably
 enlarged with unchanged mild vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in marked subcutaneous air and
 small-to-moderate right pneumothorax without interval procedure may be due to
 an air leak.  
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 17:15 by phone on
 ___ four minutes after discovery.
