                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:13 P.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  Previous right lung "whiteout." ET positioned, questioned.  New left
 subclavian line.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 7:37 p.m.:
 
 Left subclavian line ends in the upper SVC.  No left pneumothorax, pleural
 effusion or ipsilateral mediastinal widening.  Previous right mediastinal or
 paraspinal fluid collection is probably unchanged, and posteriorly layering
 right pleural effusion stable.  There is considerable atelectasis at the base
 of the right lung and mild edema in the right lung has improved.  I suspect
 the patient had been in the right decubitus position for a long period of
 time.
 
 Heart size is normal and the left lung is clear.
