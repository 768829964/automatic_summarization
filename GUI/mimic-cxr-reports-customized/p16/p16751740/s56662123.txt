                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  MCA aneurysm status post coiling, intubated.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Right lower lobe opacity is
 unchanged, most likely atelectasis and small effusion.  Right upper lobe
 atelectasis has resolved.  ET tube is in the standard position.  Left
 subclavian catheter tip is in the upper SVC.  NG tube tip is in the stomach. 
 The appearance of the upper mediastinum has improved, likely improving pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe opacity is consistent with persistent collapse
 of the right lower lobe.
