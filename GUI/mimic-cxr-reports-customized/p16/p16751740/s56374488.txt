                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage requiring intubation.  Thickened secretions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiographs shows the ET tube and left PICC in
 stable position.  Persistent right basilar opacification most likely
 represents aspiration.  The left lung base has cleared from most recent study.
 There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent right basilar opacification, most consistent with
 aspiration given history.
