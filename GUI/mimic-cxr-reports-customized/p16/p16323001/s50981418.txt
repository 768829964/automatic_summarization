                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ETT  // ETT placement      ETT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ at 13:27.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is less than 2 cm above the carina and should be
 withdrawn 2 cm for optimal placement.  Transesophageal drainage tube ends in
 the upper stomach but would need to be advanced 10 cm to move all the side
 ports beyond the GE junction.  Increasing opacification in the left lower lobe
 is presumably new atelectasis.  Right lung is clear.  Scoliosis is very
 severe.  No pneumothorax.
