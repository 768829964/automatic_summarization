                                 FINAL REPORT
 A PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 709
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post descending aorta repair with
 desaturations, question effusion, infiltrate.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at ___.
 
 The semi-erect chest film ___ at 8:30 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position.  There is improved aeration
 with residual but improving linear opacity at the right base likely reflecting
 subsegmental atelectasis.  There is also improved aeration at the left base
 suggestive of resolving atelectasis.  There continues to be diffuse
 interstitial abnormality with parenchymal distortion which is likely chronic. 
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Tracheostomy tube
 remains in satisfactory position.  Lungs are hyperinflated suggesting possible
 underlying emphysema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Possible small layering left
 effusion.
