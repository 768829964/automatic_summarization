                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:   re-intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there has
 been placement of endotracheal tube with its tip approximately 2.3 cm above
 the carina.  Pericardial drain is in place.  Metallic opacification overlying
 the right main stem bronchus most likely is external to the patient.  The PICC
 line has been removed.
 
 The long intestinal tube coils within the stomach with the tip below the level
 of the film.  Residual opacification at the left base is essentially
 unchanged.
