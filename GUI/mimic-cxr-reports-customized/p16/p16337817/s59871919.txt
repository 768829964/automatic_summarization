                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute desat while on waterseal.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___ at 8:06.  Multiple chest
 radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since prior exam, the small apical right pneumothorax is unchanged
 in size.  The right chest tube is in appropriate position in the right lung,
 although is somewhat more lateral than on the prior exam.  The lung volumes
 are lower.  Bibasilar atelectasis persists.  There is no pleural effusion,
 pulmonary edema or new consolidation.  There is no left pneumothorax. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Sternal wires are intact.  A right
 internal jugular catheter ends at the atriocaval junction.  A CoreValve
 prosthesis is noted overlying the heart.  Sternal wires are intact.  A
 Dobbhoff tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of the field of
 view.  The second tube overlies the mid abdomen and is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged small right apical pneumothorax without evidence of tension.
 2.  Stable bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence of new consolidation or
 pulmonary edema.
