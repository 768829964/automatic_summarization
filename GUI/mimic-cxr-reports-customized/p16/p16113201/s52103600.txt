                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:19 A.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with respiratory failure and volume overload.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Lateral aspect left chest is excluded from the examination, but the imaged
 portion of the left lung looks to have cleared since ___, presumably
 pulmonary edema.  The lower right lung lower lobe and possibly middle lobe
 remain collapsed and there is still at least a small-to-moderate right pleural
 effusion, but edema in the right upper lobe is also improved.
 
 Endotracheal tube at the level of the sternal notch is no less than 8 cm from
 the carina and it might be prudent to advance the tube to obtain more secured
 seating.  An upper enteric feeding tube passes to the lower esophagus and out
 of view.  Severe cardiac enlargement is still present.  Right PIC line ends in
 the upper SVC.
