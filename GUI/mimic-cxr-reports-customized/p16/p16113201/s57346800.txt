                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure with collapsed right lung.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again partial
 collapse of the right lung with some layering pleural effusion.  The hazy
 opacification at the left base is increasing, consistent with pleural effusion
 on this side and compressive atelectasis at the bases.  There also is
 suggestion of a more coalescent opacification, raising the possibility of
 increased pulmonary venous pressure and, in the appropriate clinical setting,
 possibly supervening pneumonia.
 
 The overall technical quality of the image is somewhat decreased due to
 scattered radiation related to the size of the patient.
