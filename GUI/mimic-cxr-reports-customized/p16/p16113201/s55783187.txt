                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Respiratory failure, right lung collapse.
 
 Comparison is made with the prior study, ___.
 
 There is no interval change in the right lower lobe and right middle lobe
 collapse, and in the left lung, a combination of small-to-moderate pleural
 effusion and edema.  Cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the right.  Enlarged
 cardiac silhouette is difficult is evaluate given the  parenchymal
 abnormalities.  ET tube is in standard position.  NG tube tip is out of view,
 below the diaphragm.  Central catheter tip is in the upper mediastinum/upper
 thoracic inlet, likely at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins.
