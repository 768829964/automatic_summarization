                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with ARDS and suspected new
 left lung collapse.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day
 earlier.
 
 There is overall similar appearance of the chest including the ET tube tip
 position, approximately 8.3 cm above the carina.  The left internal jugular
 line tip terminates at the junction of left brachiocephalic vein and SVC.  An
 additional line is seen projecting over the upper chest and might potentially
 represent NG tube which in this case would be with its tip position too high
 in the chest, at the level of mid esophagus, please correlate clinically. 
 Potentially it could be an outside object.  No substantial change in perihilar
 opacities, bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe atelectasis is
 demonstrated as compared to the prior study.  On the other hand, there is
 interval improvement of right lower lobe atelectasis compared to ___.
