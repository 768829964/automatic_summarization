                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for CHF.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  The radiograph is difficult to interpret.  The mediastinum is wide
 and the trachea is shifted rightward.  The heart size is not well evaluated,
 although likely significantly enlarged.  Fluffy bilateral opacities suggest
 probable mild pulmonary edema.  There are likely small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  There is no consolidation or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Wide mediastinum with deviation of the trachea is suggestive of a possible
 mediastinal mass.  If clinically indicated, further evaluation with a chest CT
 could further characterize the mediastinal abnormalities.
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema with probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Probable severe cardiomegaly.
