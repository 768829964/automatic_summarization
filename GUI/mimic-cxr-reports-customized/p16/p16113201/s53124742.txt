                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for right lower lobe reexpansion in a patient with
 right lower lobe collapse.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed and
 compared to the prior studies.  The tracheostomy tube ends 6 cm above the
 carina. An upper enteric tube terminates off the edge of the radiograph.  
 Right upper lobe expansion has minimally improved; however, complete collapse
 of the right middle lobe and right lower lobe is unchanged.  A large left
 pleural effusion is also unchanged and obscures evaluation of the cardiac
 borders.  Widening of the mediastinum, which is unchanged, indicates volume
 overload.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Complete right middle and right lower lobe collapse is unchanged.
 2.  Right upper lobe aeration has minimally improved.
 3.  Mediastinal widening, which is unchanged, indicates volume overload.
 4.  Large left pleural effusion is unchanged.
