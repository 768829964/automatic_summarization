 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ARDS, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has
 been pulled back.  The tube is now very high and could be advanced by
 approximately 2-3 cm.
 
 The nasogastric tube has an unchanged course.  Increasing parenchymal
 opacities, notably in the perihilar lung areas and at the lung bases.  The
 presence of pleural effusions bilaterally is likely.  In the well-ventilated
 areas of the lung parenchyma, there is no evidence for new parenchymal
 opacities.  Bilateral basal atelectases.
