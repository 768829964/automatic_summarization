                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with gastric cancer status post open gastrectomy
 with subsequent hypoxia and concern for aspiration.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  Again seen are bilateral pleural
 effusions with adjacent atelectasis, not significantly changed from the prior
 study.  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged in appearance.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Endotracheal tube ends 6.3 cm from the carina.  A nasogastric
 tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view.  A right-sided
 Port-A-Cath ends at the right atrium.  A left-sided central venous line ends
 at the mid SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent moderate-sized bilateral pleural effusions with
 adjacent atelectasis.
