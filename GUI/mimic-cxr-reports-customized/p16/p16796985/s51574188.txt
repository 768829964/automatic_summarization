                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with vent dependent respiratory insufficiency. 
 Evaluate interval change.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated through ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of
 endotracheal tube and placement of midline tracheostomy tube.  There has been
 interval removal of feeding tube.  A right PICC terminates at the level of the
 low superior vena cava.  A moderate sized left pneumothorax persists, stable
 in appearance, with subcutaneous air along the lateral thoracic wall, largely
 unchanged.  Dependent pulmonary edema and pleural effusion within the right
 lung appears unchanged after 1 day.  There are persistent diffuse
 opacification with air bronchograms which raises the question of ARDS. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent left moderate sized pneumothorax with subcutaneous air along the
 lateral thoracic wall which appears stable. 
 
 Unchanged pulmonary edema.
 
 Persistent diffuse opacification with air bronchograms raises the concern for
 ARDS.
