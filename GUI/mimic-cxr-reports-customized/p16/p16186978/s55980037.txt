                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypercarbic respiratory failure ___ COPD
 exacerbation s/p intubation  // post intubation     post intubation
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 20:38
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable chest radiograph ___ at 02:58 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval intubation with the endotracheal tube having its tip at the thoracic
 inlet approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  Interval placement of a
 nasogastric tube which courses below the diaphragm and the tip projects over
 the distal stomach.  Lungs are hyperinflated consistent with underlying
 emphysema.  No focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No
 pulmonary edema.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable given
 differences in patient position.  5-6 mm nodular opacity overlying the right
 sixth posterior rib is again seen and is of uncertain significance as there
 does not appear to be a CT correlate on the chest CT dated ___. 
 Followup imaging with chest radiograph in ___ months or CT should be
 considered.
