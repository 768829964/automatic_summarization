 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes. 
 Continued moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with unchanged
 pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with volume loss in
 the lower lobe and probable pleural effusion.  Tracheostomy tube remains in
 place.
 In view of the previously described areas of opacification, it in the
 appropriate clinical setting it would be very difficult to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
