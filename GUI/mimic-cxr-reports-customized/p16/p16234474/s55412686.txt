                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ YOF s/p CVA, intubated, with OGT replaced w/ NGT, increased
 PEEP requirements throughout day  // eval interval lung changes, NGT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi-upright view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina.  Right IJ central
 venous catheter is in the upper SVC.  Nasogastric tube courses below the
 diaphragm, but the tip is not clearly visualized.  There is increased
 opacification at the right base resulting in obliteration of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  There is persistent opacification at the left base and a small
 left pleural effusion.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is unchanged. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Increased opacification at the right base could represent pneumonia in the
 appropriate clinical context.
 
 2.  Parenchymal opacification and a small pleural effusion at the left base is
 unchanged.
 
 4.  Appropriate positioning of lines and tubes.
