 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the tip of the tracheostomy
 tube lies approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.  Continued bibasilar
 opacifications, more prominent on the right, consistent with pleural effusion
 and compressive atelectasis.  Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of
 normal in size or slightly enlarged and there is some elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure.
