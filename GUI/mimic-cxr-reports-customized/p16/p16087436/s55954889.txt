                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  IPH and left lower lobe pneumonia.  For evaluation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 ET tube remains in good position, 3.5 cm above the carina.  NG tube courses
 through the mediastinum.  Its tip is not seen.
 
 There is relative sparing of the left upper lung zone, otherwise the right
 lung and the left lower lung zone of diffuse opacification, unchanged from
 prior study, probably reflecting pulmonary edema.  No definitive superimposed
 pneumonia is seen.  Appearance of volume loss in the right side likely 
 reflects projection.  I wonder if the sparing of the left upper lung zone may
 reflect possible emphysematous change here.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Little interval change from prior study.
