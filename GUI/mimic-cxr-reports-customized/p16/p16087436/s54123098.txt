                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post NG tube placement for contrast.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, approximately 5.4 cm above the carina.  A left-sided
 PICC line is present, tip over proximal/mid SVC.  An OG-type tube with
 radiopaque tip is present, tip overlying the distal stomach.  If an additional
 NG-type tube is present, the tip is hard to see but may overlie the lower
 mediastinum.  Please see wet reading referring to recommendation for
 advancement.  
 
 There is probable background COPD, with prominence of the pulmonary hila,
 suggesting background pulmonary hypertension. There is upper zone
 re-distribution.  Some patchy infrahilar opacities are present bilaterally,
 similar, question slightly improved, compared with earlier the same day.
