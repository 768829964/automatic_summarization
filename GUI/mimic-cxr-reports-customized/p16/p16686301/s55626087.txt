                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxic respiratory failure, s/p ET tube
 repositioning  // ET tube positioning
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Since a recent chest radiograph from earlier today, and endotracheal tube has
 been repositioned, now terminating 6.8 cm above the Carina.  Exam is otherwise
 similar to the recent study except for slight improvement in left juxta hilar
 opacities and in the extent of peripheral consolidation in the right upper
 lobe. Masslike consolidation in the right juxta hilar region and a moderate
 right pleural effusion are unchanged
