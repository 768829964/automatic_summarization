                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change, the monitoring and support devices are in constant position. 
 Tracheostomy tube, nasogastric tube and left jugular vein catheter are
 constant.  Minimally increased is the retrocardiac atelectasis but no evidence
 of pneumonia is seen in the well-ventilated lung parenchyma.  An apparent
 increase in density at the level of the right upper lobe is due to patient's
 rotation.  Minimal fluid overload but no overt pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.
