  ET tube is in the midtrachea. Right chest tube is near the apex. No definite
  pneumothorax on this supine view with subcutaneous air seen along the right
  lateral chest wall. Marked perihilar left greater than right opacities could
  reflect vascular congestion and moderate to severe edema particuarly given
  large cardiac silhouette; however, given the patient's recent procedural
  history hematoma could also be present. Left greater than right atelectasis is
  also likely present

                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient with chest tube.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is at the midline.  The right-sided chest
 tube is near the apex.  No pneumothoraces are seen.  There is subcutaneous gas
 in the right lateral chest wall.  There are increased airspace opacities, more
 prominent in the left lung.  This may represent focal consolidation versus
 areas of fluid overload.  Followup to resolution is recommended.  There is a
 nasogastric tube whose side port is just beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
