                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Copious secretions, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 20:25 p.m., there has been interval worsening of the
 degree of opacification seen relatively diffusely throughout both lungs as
 well as more confluent opacity at the left lung base.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is enlarged, but grossly stable.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and diffuse alveolar opacities and left-greater-than-right
 pleural effusions.  There is underlying collapse and/or consolidation at the
 left base. 
  
 Subtle undulation along the right chest wall raises the question of rib
 fractures of indeterminate acuity. 
 
 A tracheostomy tube is in place. A left-sided PICC line is present.  The tip
 is not well visualized due to underpenetration.  A Dobbhoff tube is present,
 tip overlying fundus, extending beyond the inferior edge of this film. 
 Inferior subluxation of the right humeral head with respect to the glenoid is
 suggested.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Diffuse opacity in both lungs with bilateral left-greater-than-right effusions
 and left base collapse and/or consolidation, significantly worse compared with
 ___.  This could represent worsening CHF, now with pulmonary edema. 
 However, the possibility of an associated infectious infiltrate, particularly
 at the left base, cannot be excluded.
