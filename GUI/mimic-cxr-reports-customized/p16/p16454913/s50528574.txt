 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Septic shock, mesenteric ischemia, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  As a consequence, the lung parenchyma appears denser in all
 visible parts of the lung.  The size of the cardiac silhouette has mildly
 increased.  The extent of the left pleural effusion, combined to a relatively
 large left lower lung atelectasis, is unchanged.  Short-term radiographic
 followup should be performed to exclude presence of a newly appeared
 pneumonia.
