                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:18 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with diabetes after kidney and pancreas transplant
 has also had colon cancer and right thoracotomy and tracheobronchoplasty in
 ___ for tracheomalacia.  Recently had emergency cricotracheostomy for
 airway occlusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Progressive consolidation right lower lung is probably worsening pneumonia,
 possibly cavitary, accompanied by increasing small-to-moderate right pleural
 effusion.  Right upper lobe consolidation is less radiodense, but may also
 contain cavitation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette has narrowed, suggesting
 decreasing cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement.  Tracheostomy
 tube in standard placement.  Left lower lobe infrahilar consolidation is
 presumably atelectasis, unchanged.  Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is
 stable.  No pneumothorax.
