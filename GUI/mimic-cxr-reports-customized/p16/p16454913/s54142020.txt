                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate status of pulmonary edema and ARDS, now resolving,
 patient on CVVH.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Most recent radiograph from ___ at 04:35, and a series
 of older studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval decrease
 in size of the small left pleural effusion.  There is no right-sided pleural
 effusion.  Aside from persistent bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, the lungs
 are clear.  There is stable widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette,
 consistent with central vascular engorgement.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 right and left internal jugular central venous catheters are unchanged in
 position, terminating in the mid SVC.  The tracheostomy tube terminates in the
 mid trachea.  A feeding and suction tube both course into the stomach and
 inferiorly out of field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval reduction of small left pleural effusion.
 2.  Stable bibasilar atelectasis and mild hypervolemia.
