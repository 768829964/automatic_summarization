                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Acidosis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left-sided dual-lumen central venous catheter tip terminates in the proximal
 right atrium, unchanged.  The right PICC has been removed.  Mild cardiomegaly
 again is re- demonstrated.  The mediastinal contours are stable.  Tracheostomy
 tube is in unchanged position.  There has been interval improvement in the
 previous pattern of pulmonary edema.  Additionally, bilateral pleural
 effusions have also decreased in size, with persistent small left and trace
 right pleural effusions noted.  Patchy opacities in the lung bases likely
 reflect atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, improved compared to the prior study.  Decreased size of
 small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis.
