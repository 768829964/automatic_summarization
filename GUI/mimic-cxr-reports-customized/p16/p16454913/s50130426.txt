                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post laparoscopic assisted diverting colostomy.  Evaluate
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Tracheostomy and right PICC line are unchanged in position with interval
 removal of the NG tube. Right upper lobe opacity outlining the major fissure
 likely represents redistribution of effusion within the fissure. Bilateral
 effusions with associated atelectasis have increased since ___. 
 Worsened pulmonary vascular congestion with borderline pulmonary edema also
 compromises respiratory reserve.  Adjacent pleural effusion accentuates the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Larger bilateral pleural effusions with associated atelectasis limit lung
 volumes. Worsening pulmonary vascular congestion and borderline pulmonary
 edema also compromise respiratory reserve.
 
 Telephone notification to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 10:10 on ___.
