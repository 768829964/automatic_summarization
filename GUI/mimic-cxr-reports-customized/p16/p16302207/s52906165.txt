                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Polytrauma, evaluate chest tubes.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VW
 
 An ET tube tip approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.  NG tube beneath
 diaphragm overlying stomach.  A left subclavian central line over mid
 SVC.Another line overlying the upper mediastinum may represent a temperature
 probe.  Left and right-sided chest tubes are present.  No obvious
 pneumothorax.  
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes with bibasilar patchy opacity, consistent
 with collapse and/or consolidation.  Mild upper zone redistribution and
 vascular blurring is slightly improved and likely accentuated by low
 inspiratory volumes.  Prominence of the mediastinum is again noted, similar to
 prior.
