                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:48 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new shortness of breath and tachycardia.  Is
 there pneumothorax or worsened pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ at 10:51 a.m.:
 
 Patient had mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema with basal predominance on
 ___ that cleared more completely in the right lung than the left, and
 that disparity persists raising the possibility of left-sided pneumonia. 
 Right pleural drainage tube unchanged in position.  No pneumothorax or
 appreciable pleural effusion.  Heart is partially obscured by abnormality in
 the left lung, but probably stably enlarged.  Tracheostomy tube in standard
 placement.  Cuff mildly overinflated.  Left subclavian line ends at the origin
 of the SVC.  Alternatively, this could be asymmetric pulmonary edema, it could
 be explained if the patient is in persistent left decubitus position or the
 very rare circumstance of a large pulmonary embolus occluding circulation to
 the right lung protecting it from edema on that side.  Dr. ___ was paged. 
 Left subclavian line ends at the origin of the SVC.  No pneumothorax.
