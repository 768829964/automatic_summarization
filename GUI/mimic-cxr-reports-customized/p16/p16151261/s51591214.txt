                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p MCC w/ C5 fracture and quadriplegia s/p PEG
 on ___ with right sided free air noted on prior scans and partial left lower
 lung collapse.  Assess for interval change of right sided free air, assess for
 interval change of left lower lung.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___, ___. 
 Trauma torso of ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, left basilar consolidation may be due to volume
 loss, however superimposed pneumonia is not excluded, especially given the
 absence of a lateral view.  The left PICC line tip is at the cavoatrial
 junction.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes are similar in appearance. 
 Tracheostomy appears in place.  Incidental note is made of spinal hardware and
 a right clavicular fracture, as seen on the initial trauma torso from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left basilar consolidation may be due to volume loss, however superimposed
 pneumonia is not excluded, especially given the absence of a lateral view.
 
 2.  No evidence of free subdiaphragmatic air on this single view.
