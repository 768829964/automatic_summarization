                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 4:26 A.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Evaluate lines and
 tubes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 New peribronchial opacification in the left lower lobe on ___ has
 resolved, presumably atelectasis.  Lungs are low in volume but clear.  There
 is no pleural abnormality.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  ET tube
 and right internal jugular line are in standard placements.  An upper enteric
 drainage tube passes as far as the distal stomach, but its course after that
 is uncertain.  Transvenous pacer defibrillator lead tip projects over the
 lower right ventricle, as before.  No pneumothorax.
