                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been placement of a Dobbhoff tube that coils in the lower
 body of the stomach.  Extremely limited study due to scattered radiation
 related to the size of the patient.  Tracheostomy tube appears to be in good
 position and a right IJ catheter extends to the mid to lower portion of the
 SVC.  Bilateral pulmonary opacifications are again seen, more prominent on the
 right.
