                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Fever and altered mental status.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  Exam is limited due
 to poor patient positioning.  Underpenetrated technique also limits the
 evaluation.  Allowing for this, there is no significant interval change with
 no definite signs of acute consolidation or large pneumothorax/effusion. 
 Please note the left lung base is poorly assessed.  Bony structures appear
 grossly intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited, no acute findings.  If there is strong clinical concern,
 a repeat with dedicated PA and lateral views of the chest may be obtained to
 further assess.
