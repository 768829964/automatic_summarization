                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with history of right multilobar
 pneumonia, right empyema status post chest tube removal with small
 pneumothorax and tachypnea.  Study requested for evaluation of reaccumulation
 of effusion and/or pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, trace
 right apical pneumothorax remains. Lung volumes remain low.  There are
 persistent right multilobar opacities and there is pulmonary congestion. Loss
 of the left hemidiaphragm could be related to a small pleural effusion and
 volume loss. Retrocardiac air bronchograms could represent pneumonia. Heart is
 enlarged but stable when compared to prior examination. A right-sided IJ
 central venous catheter tip is seen at the cavoatrial junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: Persistent right multilobar opacities with trace right apical
 pneumothorax.
