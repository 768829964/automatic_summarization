                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 Upon further review, the apparent loss of height in the mid-thoracic vertebral
 body is the result of a rib and a fissure projecting over a vertebral body of
 normal height.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with right multilobar pneumonia and empyema with
 chest tube and small pneumothorax.
 
 Chest tube removed on ___.
 
 STUDY:  AP upright with grid and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ (post pleural catheter removal).
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart size is large but stable compared to prior exam.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Again multiple
 consolidations are present in the upper and lower portions of the right lung
 with apparent pleural-based opacities along the lateral aspect of the chest. 
 Possibly trace apical pneumothorax remains.  There is mild increase in
 right-sided pleural fluid, likely loculated within peripheral pleural spaces. 
 A right-sided IJ central venous catheter tip sits at the cavoatrial junction. 
 A mid-to-upper thoracic vertebral body demonstrates loss of height which is
 new compared to prior CT from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Status post pleural catheter removal with small amount of loculated
 pleural fluid remaining and trace to no appreciable apical pneumothorax.
 2.  Stable cardiomegaly.
