 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:43 PM
  Significant improvement of previously larger right pleural effusion status
  post pigtail catheter placement.  Small residual effusion.  No pneumothorax. 
  Persistent right upper and lower lobe airspace opacities compatible with
  pneumonia.  The right hilus is enlarged.  Follow up imaging to resolution is
  necessary to exclude central obstructing mass.  Right IJ central line tip at
  the cavoatrial junction.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Multifocal pneumonia, pleural effusion, status post
 thoracocentesis and pigtail placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 4:42 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 right thoracocentesis and a pigtail catheter has been placed into the right
 pleural space.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or other complication. 
 The previous fluid in the pleural space is almost completely resolved. 
 Relatively extensive right parenchymal changes persist, reflecting multifocal
 pneumonia.  The left lung is unchanged.  Unchanged position of the monitoring
 and support devices.
