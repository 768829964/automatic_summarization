 FINDINGS:  There has been interval worsening of multifocal opacities,
 especially in the anterior segment of the right upper lobe with near-complete
 opacification clearly outlining the minor fissure.  Opacities are also worse
 in bilateral apices, the lingula and both lung bases, worrisome for
 progressive multifocal pneumonia.  There is no large effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Worsening multifocal opacities particularly in the anterior segment of the

 progressive multifocal pneumonia.
