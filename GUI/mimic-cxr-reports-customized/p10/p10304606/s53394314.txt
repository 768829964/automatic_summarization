  No significant interval change in the appearance of the chest compared to
  radiograph from ___. Apparent mediastinal widening likely secondary
  to patient obliquity. Lung volumes low, with mild increased interstitial
  markings left greater than right, possibly secondary to mild interstitial
  edema. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. No focal consolidation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with shortness of breath.  // Please eval for
 pulmonary edema, effusion, and consolidation.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Rotation of the patient limits the evaluation of the study. Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly unchanged with apparent mediastinal widening likely due
 to the projection. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Minimal
 increase in the interstitial markings in the left lung suggest asymmetric
 edema no evidence of lobar pneumonia.
