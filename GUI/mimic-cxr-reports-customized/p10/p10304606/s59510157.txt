                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ET tube/lines  // ET tube/line placement,
 vascular congestion, acute intrapulm process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  The patient is markedly rotated which limits
 assessment.  A tracheostomy is in-situ, unchanged in position compared to the
 prior study.  A right internal jugular dialysis catheter and a left internal
 jugular vascular access catheter are both positioned with the tip in the mid
 SVC.  Hazy opacity throughout the left lung is similar in appearance compared
 to the prior study.  Appearances are most consistent with pulmonary edema.  No
 definite pleural effusion seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings consistent with pulmonary edema.  Appearances are similar when
 compared to the prior study.
