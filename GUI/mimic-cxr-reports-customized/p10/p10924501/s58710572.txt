 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube has been repositioned with its tip ending
 approximately 5.5-6 cm above the carina and is appropriate.  Left subclavian
 line ends at mid SVC.  Orogastric tube is seen to course below the diaphragm
 into the stomach and is appropriate.  Bilateral lung volumes are low.  Bibasal
 atelectasis is no different from prior radiograph.  Heart size, mediastinal
