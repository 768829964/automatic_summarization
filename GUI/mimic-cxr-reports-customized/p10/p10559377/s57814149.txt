  Tracheostomy tube projects over the midline of the trachea.  There has been
  slight interval decrease in the left pleural effusion, likely related to
  thoracentesis. No evidence of pneumothorax. Diffuse bilateral pulmonary
  opacities are essentially unchanged.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ___ yo IVDU p/w Strep Group C bacteremia c/b
 toxic shock -> STEMI/CRT/Alv Hemmorhages/p left thoracentesis 1.2l // s/p
 ___. ?pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the most recent radiograph, there is no significant interval
 change in the degree of right lower lobe collapse and moderate right pleural
 effusion.  Extensive bilateral airspace opacities are minimally improved on
 the left, and again may be due to severe pulmonary edema, hemorrhage or
 multifocal pneumonia.  Moderate left pleural effusion with associated partial
 left lower lobe collapse is also unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal improvement in bilateral airspace opacities which may be due to severe
 pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, or multifocal pneumonia.
 Stable lower lobe collapse with moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
