                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient with acute on chronic
 respiratory failure, now with increased respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a tracheostomy, unchanged in
 position.  The cardiac silhouette is difficult to evaluate secondary to
 opacity in the bilateral lung bases, but appears increased in size.  Bilateral
 diffuse opacities are increased.  Bilateral pleural effusions are increased. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased opacities associated with increased cardiac size and pleural
 effusions are most consistent with increased edema, although multifocal
 pneumonia, hemorrhage, and ARDS remain on the differential.
