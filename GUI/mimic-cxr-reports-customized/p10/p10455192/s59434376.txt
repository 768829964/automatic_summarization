                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 11:44
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with question VAP, evaluate for
 consolidation.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ and 14:31.
 
 Portable semi-upright chest film ___ at 11:44 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and left subclavian central line are
 unchanged in position.  Lung volumes remain markedly low with crowding of the
 pulmonary vasculature and bibasilar opacities suggestive of partial lower lobe
 atelectasis.  Probable layering bilateral effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Given
 the markedly low lung volumes, assessment of cardiac and mediastinal contours
 is difficult.
