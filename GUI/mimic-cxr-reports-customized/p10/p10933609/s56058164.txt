                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.  Assess for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Basilar opacity seen on the lateral view best corresponds to a
 retrocardiac opacity suspicious for developing left lower lobe pneumonia or
 aspiration event in the setting of altered mental status.  Chronic
 peribronchiolar opacities seen bilaterally are similar in distribution and
 slightly more apparent due to lower lung volumes and AP technique.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal with normal
 cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe opacity likely reflects pneumonia or aspiration.
