                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Left chest, AP and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  DVT presenting with lower right chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There are
 low lung volumes.  Right upper lobe scarring/chronic fibrosis in the right
 greater than left upper lobes are again seen.  New since the prior study,
 there is left mid lung streaky opacity and to a lesser extent in the left
 lower lobe.  No pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable right greater than left upper lobe fibrotic changes.  New
 opacity in the left mid-to-lower lung raises concern for infectious process
 versus possibly asymmetric edema.  Recommend followup to resolution.
