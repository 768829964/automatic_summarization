 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with altered mental status, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous
 exam from ___.  There is new multifocal consolidation in the right
 upper lobe, within the right perihilar region and possibly in the retrocardiac
 region as well.  Lungs are otherwise notable for parenchymal architectural
 distortion at the upper lungs bilaterally.  There is no effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.  Osseous and soft tissue
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Multifocal regions of consolidation, new since exam from two
 weeks prior, compatible with pneumonia in the proper clinical setting. 
 Recommend repeat after treatment to document resolution.
