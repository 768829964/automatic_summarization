                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AMS, recent I&D left forearm abscess, now persistent pleuritic chest
 pain.  New PICC line.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 Compared with ___, a right-sided subclavian PICC line has been placed.  The
 tip overlies the SVC/RA junction or upper right atrium.   No pneumothorax is
 detected.  
 
 There are slightly low inspiratory volumes.  The heart is not enlarged.
 There are patchy interstial markings predominantly in both upper lobes,
 similar to findings on several prior CT scans and unchanged compared with
 ___ CXR. Ill-definition of both hila is likely secondary to obscuration by
 the interstial markings.  There is minimal blunting of both costophrenic
 angles.  No frank consolidation or gross effusion.  No obvious pneumothorax. 
 Clips noted in the upper abdomen near the GE junction.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) PICC line tip over SVC/RA junction or upper right atrium.  If clinically
 indicated, this could be retracted by approximately 2 cm.
 
 2) Chronic patchy interstial opacities both upper lobes, unchanged.
 
 3) No new infiltrate identified.
