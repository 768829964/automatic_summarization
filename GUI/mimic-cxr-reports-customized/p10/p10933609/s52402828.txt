                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever of unclear source.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  There are low lung volumes.  The heart
 size is within normal limits.  Peribronchial opacities bilaterally are similar
 when compared to the prior study.  Previously noted left lower lobe opacity
 appears improved when compared to the prior exam, suggestive of resolving
 pneumonia.  No new focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax is
 seen.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.  Radiopaque densities
 projecting over the right shoulder joint are unchanged as is a surgical clip
 within the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of the left lower lobe suggesting resolving
 pneumonia.
