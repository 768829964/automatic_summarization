                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Overdose.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 3.8 cm from the carina.  An
 orogastric tube tip is noted within the distal stomach.  Lung volumes are low.
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is noted, and mild pulmonary vascular congestion is
 likely present.  Additionally, more focal somewhat linear opacities within
 both upper lobes appear to be associated with fibrotic changes.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is identified, although the right costophrenic angle
 is excluded from the field of view.  Diffuse gaseous distention of the bowel
 loops are noted within the upper abdomen.  No acute osseous abnormality seen. 
 Surgical anchors are noted projecting over the right shoulder.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Standard positions of the endotracheal and orogastric tubes.
 
 2. Focal, somewhat linear opacities within both upper lobes which may be due
 to a chronic interstitial process.  Correlation with prior imaging is
 recommended.  Aspiration or infection, however, cannot be completely excluded.
 
 3. Mild pulmonary vascular congestion in the setting of low lung volumes.
