 CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  New-onset shortness of breath.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right-sided PICC line and left-sided rib fractures are
 unchanged.  A lucency is seen at the left apex, but a chest CT done three
 hours later failed to show a pneumothorax and therefore this artifactual. 
 There is bilateral lower lobe opacities, compatible with volume
 loss/infiltrate.  The one on the right is slightly improved and the one on the
 left is slightly worse.
