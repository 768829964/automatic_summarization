                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, to assess for effusion in heart size.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are in unchanged position.  Two left chest tubes remain in place and
 there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is less
 prominent than on the previous image, possibly reflecting change in patient
 position.  The apparent widening of the superior mediastinum is also less
 prominent.  Mild vascular congestion is again seen.
