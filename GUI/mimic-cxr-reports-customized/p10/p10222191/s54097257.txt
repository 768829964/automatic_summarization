 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with severe pancreatitis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An NG tube tip and sidehole are positioned within the lower esophagus.  A
 feeding tube remains in place below the diaphragm, though its tip is not seen.
 A tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position.  A left IJ approach central
 venous catheter tip is positioned within the distal left brachiocephalic vein.
 
 
 Lung volumes remain adequate, there is minimal bibasilar atelectasis, slightly
 improved.  Small bilateral effusions are unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature
 appears normal.  The cardiac silhouette, mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  NG tube tip and sidehole within the lower esophagus, which could place the
 patient at risk for aspiration, and should be advanced.
 
 2.  Unchanged to slightly improved bibasilar atelectasis with adequate lung
 volumes.
