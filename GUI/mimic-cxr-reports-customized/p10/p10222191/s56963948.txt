                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup of pleural effusions.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 13 hours earlier.
 
 Allowing the difference in technique and positioning of the patient, stable
 bilateral pleural effusions are moderate on the left and small-to-moderate on
 the right.  Tracheostomy tube is in a standard position.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis are larger on the left side.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged
 standard position.
