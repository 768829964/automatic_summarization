                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with cough and fever.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate prominent
 cardiac silhouette, similar as compared to prior exam.  There is slightly
 increased haziness in the lungs, likely reflecting mild interstitial edema. 
 Linear bands of scarring and/or atelectasis in bilateral lung bases are
 unchanged.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall similar appearance of mild interstitial edema and
 bibasilar scarring and/or atelectasis.  Correlate clinically for possibility
 of early infection.  No radiographic evidence of confluent consolidation.
