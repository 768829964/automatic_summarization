                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with HCAP s/p 8d abx, s/p chest tubes for
 bilateral pleural effusions, intermittent hypoxemia yesterday with increase in
 effusions, please evaluate for interval change in effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bilateral small pleural effusions persist and are minimally improved from the
 prior exam if at all.  A focal opacity just above the pleural effusions is
 probably loculated pleural fluid along the minor fissure. Adjacent compressive
 atelectasis is minimally improved.  Lung volumes remain low.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Right pulmonary edema is mild.
 Aortic knob calcifications again noted.  The left PICC line is unchanged and
 ends in the distal SVC.  The left internal jugular vein ends at the origin of
 the left brachiocephalic vein.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis, minimally
 improved, with mild right pulmonary edema.
