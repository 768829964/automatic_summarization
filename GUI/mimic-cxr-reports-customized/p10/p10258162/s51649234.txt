                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right internal jugular central venous catheter pulled back. 
 Assess position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  CT torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval extubation and removal of an enteric
 catheter.  The right internal jugular central venous catheter has been
 slightly withdrawn, now ending in the low SVC.  A moderate layering left
 pleural effusion is not significantly changed.  Although no definite right
 pleural effusion is seen on today's study, one was present on the prior CT
 from ___.  Moderate left retrocardiac atelectasis is likely
 compressive from the adjacent effusion.   Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is
 improved.  Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Marked degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine
 are noted including dextroscoliosis.  A displaced right proximal humeral
 fracture is redemonstrated. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the low SVC, status
 post repositioning.
 
 2.  No significant interval change in moderate left pleural effusion or degree
 of left lower lung compressive atelectasis.
 
 3.  Decreased mild interstitial pulmonary edema.
