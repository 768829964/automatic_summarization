                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with recent aspiration, bleeding from
 tracheostomy site, now status post bronchoscopy.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study obtained seven hours earlier during the same day.  The ostomy is in
 place and position its appears to have adjusted since preceding study. 
 Position of previously described right internal jugular approach wide-bore
 double-lumen catheter unchanged, the same holds for the left subclavian line. 
 No pneumothorax is present.  The previously described bilateral patchy
 parenchymal densities remain rather unchanged.  Diffuse haze over right-sided
 hemithorax again interpreted as representing pleural effusion layering in the
 posterior compartments.  Total subcapital right humerus fracture as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings, no significant interval change since next
 preceding study obtained seven hours earlier.
