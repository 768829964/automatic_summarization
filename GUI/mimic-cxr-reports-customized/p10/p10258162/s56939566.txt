                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with chest pain with tracheostomy, on vent. 
 Assess for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Tracheostomy
 tube is in unchanged position.  Right internal jugular catheter has been
 removed with left PICC having been withdrawn to the level of confluence of the
 brachiocephalic veins.  Diffuse parenchymal opacity is improved with
 persistent retrocardiac consolidation and left greater than right small
 pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Aortic calcifications are noted
 with normal cardiac size.  Gastrostomy tube is incompletely imaged in the
 upper abdomen. Sclerotic lesion in the left proximal humerus is unchanged with
 old right proximal humerus fracture incompletely assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Decreased pulmonary opacification with retrocardiac consolidation which
 could reflect aspiration or infectious process.
 2.  Right PICC now located at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins.
