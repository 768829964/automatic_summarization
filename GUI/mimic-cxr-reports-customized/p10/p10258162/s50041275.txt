  No significant change from the prior exam. An orogastric tube is in place and
  terminates within the stomach with the distal tip not included on the
  radiograph.  Other indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
  position with left central tip terminating in the midline, similar in position
  to the prior exam and ETT 3.1 cm above carina.. Opacities within the right
  lung remain most prominent in the central perihilar region similar to the
  prior exam. Small pleural effusions are probably not changed allowing for
  differences in radiographic positioning.  Left chest tube in place.  Tiny left
  apical pneumothorax similar to prior.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Evaluate extent of pneumothorax in a patient with known
 pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine portable chest radiograph was performed, with
 comparison to the examination performed approximately 7 hours previously.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 An endotracheal tube is again seen, with the tip approximately 3 cm above the
 carina.  NG tube is present, curled within the stomach.  Left-sided central
 venous catheter is present, with the tip at the junction of the
 brachiocephalic vein.  Right-sided subclavian dialysis catheter is also noted,
 the tip of this is unchanged, somewhat higher than usual at the level of the
 cavoatrial junction.  A left-sided chest tube is present, unchanged.  
 
 Again, multifocal pulmonary opacities are seen predominantly in the left
 upper-to-mid lung zones, and appearing relatively unchanged.  There may be
 slight improvement of the overall appearance of edema within the right
 hemithorax.  A small left-sided pleural effusion is present, unchanged.  A
 trace right-sided pleural effusion is also likely present.  No new
 pneumothorax.  Degenerative changes are seen at the shoulders.  A notable
 scoliosis of the lumbar spine is seen, convex to the right.  Vascular
 calcifications are noted at the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Pneumothorax as questioned is no longer apparent, presumably expanded given
 the presence of the chest tube.
