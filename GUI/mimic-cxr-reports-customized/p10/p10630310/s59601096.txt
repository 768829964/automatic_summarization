                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained the same day earlier.
 
 The Dobbhoff tube has been advanced and is currently within the stomach, which
 is still substantially distended, but overall appears to be slightly improved
 as compared to prior study obtained at 08:15 a.m.  Minimal bibasilar
 atelectases are present.
