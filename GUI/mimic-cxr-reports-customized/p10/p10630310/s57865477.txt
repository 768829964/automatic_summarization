                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Increased seizure activity, unresponsive.
 
 No prior examinations for comparison.
 
 CHEST, AP:  Lung volumes are low, with crowding of bronchovascular markings. 
 Increased opacity at the lung bases may be due to atelectasis or aspiration. 
 There are no large pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis or aspiration.  If
 possible, repeat two-view radiograph at full inspiration would be helpful.
