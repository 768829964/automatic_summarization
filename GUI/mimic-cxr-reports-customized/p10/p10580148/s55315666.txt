                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 5 EXAMS
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NGT, needs replacement with dobhoff tube  //
 Please assess dobhoff tube positioning      in
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 5 successive frontal chest radiographs show repositioning of the intended
 transesophageal feeding tube, first in the right main bronchus, then in the
 right lower or middle lobe bronchus, then at the thoracic inlet (probably the
 airway once again), then in the mid esophagus, then the region of the
 gastroesophageal junction.
 
 Regions of heterogeneous opacification of both lung bases are larger today
 than on ___.  Unfortunately the lateral aspect of the right hemithorax
 is excluded from All images, and it is difficult to say whether this
 represents asymmetric edema alone or edema and new bilateral consolidation at
 the lung bases.  There is no left pleural effusion or pneumothorax on either
 side.  Heart size is normal.
 
 Tracheostomy tube midline.  Right jugular line ends in the mid SVC, right
 subclavian line ends in the low SVC.
