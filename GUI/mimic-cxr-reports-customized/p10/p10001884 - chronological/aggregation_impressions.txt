21280929 No acute intrathoracic process.
21290528 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
21290825 1. No focal consolidation to suggest active infection.2. Stable  COPD.3. Stable unexplained mild rightward deviation of the trachea.
21291006 No acute cardiopulmonary process, without consolidation or evidence of CHF.
21300216 Subtle opacity in the right lower lobe could represent atelectasis or infection in the appropriate setting.
21300408 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
21300415 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
21300623 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
21300906 No evidence of pneumonia.  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
21300930 Mild bibasilar atelectasis.  No evidence of pneumonia.
21301005 No acute cardiopulmonary process.
21301008 Relative increase in opacity over the lung bases bilaterally felt due to overlying soft tissue rather than consolidation.  Lateral view may be helpful for confirmation.
21301009 There is hyperinflation.  There is no pneumothorax, effusion, consolidation or CHF.  There is probable osteopenia.

21310114 Exam is otherwise remarkable for probable small bilateral pleural effusions.
