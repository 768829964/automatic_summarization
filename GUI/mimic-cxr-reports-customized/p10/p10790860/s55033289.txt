                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of ARDS, intubated.  Please evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dated back to ___ and chest CT from
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is an enteric tube which extends below the diaphragm, the tip
 incompletely evaluated on this exam.  ET tube terminates approximately 3.8 cm
 above the carina.  Left-sided pacer leads terminate appropriately in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Left internal jugular catheter has an unchanged
 position and course.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly with extensive bilateral parenchymal opacities at the
 lung bases is unchanged.  Mild-to-moderate left pleural effusion is
 persistent.  There is no evidence of a pneumothorax.  Visualized osseous
 structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 No significant interval change in the extensive bilateral parenchymal
 opacities at the lung bases, consistent with moderate pulmonary edema.
