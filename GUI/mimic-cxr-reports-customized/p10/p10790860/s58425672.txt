                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea  // eval for volume overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Previously seen midline tracheostomy is no longer seen.  There has also been
 interval removal of a left-sided IJ venous catheter. A right-sided PICC is
 seen, distal aspect not well appreciated on this study due to overlying
 opacity, but does appear to course into at least the superior SVC. Dual lead
 left-sided pacemaker is again seen with leads extending to the expected
 positions of the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is interval increase
 in bilateral, right greater than left pulmonary opacities, which given
 history, likely due to slight asymmetric pulmonary edema, however,
 superimposed infectious process is not excluded. There is a small right
 pleural effusion.  The left costophrenic angle is not well seen and there may
 be a trace left pleural effusion. The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval increase in bilateral, right greater than left, pulmonary opacities,
 which given history, likely due to slight asymmetric pulmonary edema, however,
 superimposed infectious process is not excluded. Small right pleural effusion
 and possible trace left pleural effusion.
