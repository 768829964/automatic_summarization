                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with effusion s/p chest tube  // Interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 555
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tube overlying the upper mediastinum raises the question of interval
 placement of a tracheostomy tube.  Linear density over the mediastinum in the
 midline likely represents an NG tube.  On today's study, due to
 underpenetration, this is traced only to the level of the diaphragm.  It may
 very well course beyond that, but be obscured by underpenetration.
 
 A left subclavian central line and right subclavian PICC line are again noted.
 The tips are not well delineated in a partially obscured by the overlying
 right pleural drain, but both appear to lie in the region of the SVC/RA
 junction. No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Again seen are low inspiratory volumes, stable prominence the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette, CHF, moderate bilateral pleural effusions each
 with underlying collapse and/or consolidation, all similar to the prior study.
 Again seen is tubing in the region the right hilum, apparently a right-sided
 drain.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Question interval placement of tracheostomy tube.  Otherwise, overall similar
 to the prior study.  Please note that on today's exam, likely due to
 underpenetration, the NG tube cannot be traced beyond the level of the
 diaphragm.
