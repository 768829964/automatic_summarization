                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubated, on pressors  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior exams, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  A left subclavian central venous catheter terminates
 in the mid to the low SVC.  The endotracheal tube terminates at the level of
 the clavicles.  A nasogastric tube can be traced to the lower esophagus. 
 Moderate pleural effusions with bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis are
 unchanged.  Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged.  The heart and mediastinum
 cannot be accurately assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.
 
 Nasogastric tube can only be traced to the lower esophagus.  A repeat frontal
 radiograph with attention to optimal positioning is suggested if the tip
 location is in question.
