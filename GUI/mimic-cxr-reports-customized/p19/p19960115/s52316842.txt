                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:
 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:
 ___ year old man with pancreaticoduodenectomy s/p recent ICU transfer,
 intubation, bronchoscopy  // eval for reexpansion s/p bronchoscopy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest single view
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 05:30
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There continues to be bilateral moderate pleural effusions with opacification
 of both lower lungs which may be due to volume loss/ infiltrate/effusion. 
 There is pulmonary vascular redistribution with hazy alveolar infiltrate in
 the right upper lobe greater than left upper lobe the heart continues to be
 moderately enlarged the mediastinum is prominent, likely due the vascular
 engorgement the ET tube position is unchanged the overall impression is that
 of persistent pulmonary edema.  It is difficult to assess for lower lobe
 re-expansion given the amount of pleural fluid
