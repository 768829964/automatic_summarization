                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recurrent epidural abscess with pulmonary emboli.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right IJ catheter terminates at the caval atrial junction.  An endotracheal
 tube is unchanged in position, terminating 6.2 cm above the carina.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is a trace left pleural
 effusion. A persistent left retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis.
 There is no pneumothorax or new consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent left retrocardiac opacity, likely atelectasis, though underlying
 consolidation cannot be excluded. No new opacities. Unchanged small left
 pleural effusion.
