                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  History of heart failure and COPD now with shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs the chest dated ___ through
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable, semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resulting bronchovascular crowding.  There is increased opacification of
 the bilateral bases to the mid lung fields, which most likely represents
 pulmonary edema, however underlying infection cannot be excluded.  There is
 severe cardiomegaly, which is stable.  There are small to moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions.  There is no pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Increased opacification of the bilateral bases to the mid lung fields,
 which most likely represents pulmonary edema, however underlying infection
 cannot be excluded.  
 
 2.  Stable cardiomegaly. 
 
 3.  Small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
