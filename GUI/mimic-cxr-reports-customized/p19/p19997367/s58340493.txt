 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intubation, status post bilateral tapping of pleural effusion. 
 Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:55 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal
 hyperlucency at the level of the left lung base, potentially representing an
 indirect sign for minimal post-procedural pneumothorax.  Otherwise, the
 radiograph is unchanged.  No left pleural effusion, moderate right pleural
 effusion.  Unchanged appearance of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged
 monitoring and support devices.
