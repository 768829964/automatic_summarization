                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Again there are bilateral pleural effusions, more prominent on the right, with
 underlying compressive atelectasis.  Pacer devices are essentially unchanged,
 as is the Port-A-Cath.  No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
