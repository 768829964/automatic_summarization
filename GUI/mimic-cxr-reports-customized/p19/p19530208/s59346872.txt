 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with new multifocal pna on chest x-ray,
 hypotension  // please evaluate for pneumonia      please evaluate for
 pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the CT examination of this date, the asymmetric
 opacification in the right upper zone is consistent with pneumonia. Continued
 elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour with atelectatic changes
 above it.  The deep Dobhoff tube has been further advanced an has its tip
 pointing downward on the current study.  ,
