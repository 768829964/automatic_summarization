                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 11:37 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with respiratory failure after intubation.  Check
 ET tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 New ET tube in standard placement.  Upper enteric drainage tube passes into a
 non-distended stomach and out of view.  No central venous line noted.  Right
 caval venous filter, unchanged in appearance recently.  Multifocal pulmonary
 consolidation has improved slightly, still quite severe.  Some of the change
 could be due to the effects of positive pressure ventilation or diuresis. 
 Suggestion of cavitation in some regions of consolidation suggests
 staphylococcus infection as an alternative to viral pneumonia.  In addition,
 the two can coexist.
