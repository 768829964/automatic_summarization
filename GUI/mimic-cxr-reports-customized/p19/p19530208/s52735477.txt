                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with renal transplantation
 with varicella zoster virus and hypoxemia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.  There is interval development of
 multifocal opacities, some of them are relatively rounded and some of them are
 ill-defined, highly concerning for multifocal infection, potentially viral. 
 If clinically warranted, further assessment with chest CT for precise
 characterization of pulmonary abnormalities is recommended.  Small amount of
 pleural effusion is most likely present.  There is no pneumothorax.
