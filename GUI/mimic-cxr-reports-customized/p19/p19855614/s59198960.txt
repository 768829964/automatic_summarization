                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post right-sided
 venous/peritoneal shunt with repair of posterior fossa.  Now with increased
 sensations.  Evaluate for pneumonia or aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study of ___.  The patient remains
 intubated, the cannula remains in unchanged position.  No pneumothorax has
 developed.  Heart size remains normal and no pulmonary vascular congestion is
 present.  There remains a mild elevation of the left diaphragm, apparently
 related to this gas-distended stomach and-or large bowel.  The on previous
 examination suspected mild crowding of the pulmonary vasculature has not
 progressed and thus, there is no evidence of any new pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrate.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.
