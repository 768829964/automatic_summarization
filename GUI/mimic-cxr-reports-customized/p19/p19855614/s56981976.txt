 HISTORY:  Pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  The tip of the endotracheal tube is just above the clavicular level
 and could be pushed forward 2-3 cm for better seating.  There may be a tiny
 right apical pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacifications are again consistent with
 aspiration pneumonia.
