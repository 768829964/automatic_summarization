 WET READ: ___ ___ 6:28 PM
  ET tube 3.7cm above the carina.  The PICC line catheter tip is in the mid-to-
  lower SVC.  NG tube tip iin expected region of stomach.  Right IJ catheter
  sheath tip is at  the confluence of the right IJ and right subclavian veins.
  Mild cardiomegaly with silhouette slighlty accentuated by low lung vol.
  Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are  unchanged.  Adjacent
  bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis however infectious process can't be
  excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Increased pulmonary vascular
  engorgement consistent with mild pul edema.

 HISTORY:  Check ET tube.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___ at 05:45.
