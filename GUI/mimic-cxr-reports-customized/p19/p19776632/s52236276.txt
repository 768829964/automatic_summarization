  Interval placement of tracheostomy tube ending 4.1 cm above the carina. Stable
  position of left subclavian central venous line and NG tube. Unchanged
  appearance of multi focal pneumonia. Metallic density tube projecting over the
  left upper hemithorax is likely external to the patient.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new trach  // Eval post trach
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of tracheostomy tube in standard position, with no evidence
 of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Multifocal alveolar opacities have
 partially cleared in the right mid and lower lung, but have worsen in the left
 lower lobe. Apparent new area of consolidation in left juxta hilar region is
 difficult to confirm due to superimposition of external devices. Attention to
 this region on the repeat radiograph with repositioning of this external
 support devices would be helpful. Small left pleural effusion is unchanged.
