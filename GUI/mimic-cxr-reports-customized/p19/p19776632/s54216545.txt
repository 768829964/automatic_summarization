 change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 05:29
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 05:04
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. There continues to be
 bilateral diffuse parenchymal opacities with more focal confluent area in the
 left upper lung. Overall, the aeration may have slightly improved in the left
 upper lung when compared to the most recent prior study.  No pleural
 effusions. No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique. Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are unchanged given patient rotation.
