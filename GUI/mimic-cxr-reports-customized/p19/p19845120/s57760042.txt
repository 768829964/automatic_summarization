                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Diabetes, CKD, HTN, AFib admitted with ___ and septic shock, GIB,
 now worsening cough, question interval change in cardiopulmonary process,
 particularly the left side where opacification was seen on ___.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 A left-sided PICC line is present.  The tip is not well seen, but may overlie
 the distal SVC.
 
 An orogastric-type tube is present.  The radiopaque tip overlies the expected
 site of the gastric fundus.  However, note is made that the diaphragm itself
 is obscured so that precise position is not well demonstrated.  The appearance
 is similar to the prior radiograph.  
 
 There is slightly rotated positioning. As on the ___ radiograph, there is
 cardiomegaly with increased retrocardiac density and obscuration of left
 hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. 
 Associated left pleural effusion may be present.  As noted, the level of the
 diaphragm is not well delineated.    Mild vascular plethora and minimal fluid
 or thickening along the middle fissure suggests mild vascular congestion,
 grossly unchanged.  Minimal atelectasis in the right cardiophrenic region is
 also unchanged.  No gross right effusion identified.  No new area of
 opacification or infiltrate is detected. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Left lower lobe collapse/consolidation, similar to ___.
 2) Mild vascular congestion, unchanged.
 3) Minimal right cardiophrenic atelecasis, unchanged. 
 4) Limited assessment of position of tip or orogastric-type tube. Please see
 comment above.
