                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fall.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies with the most recent one obtained on ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 3 cm above the carina.  The left PICC line tip is at the
 level of mid SVC.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are stable.  Slight interval improvement in the right lower lung
 aeration may be consistent with slight improvement of pulmonary edema.  Small
 pleural effusion is most likely present on the right.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
