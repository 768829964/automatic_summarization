                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  OG tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained
 earlier.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is in the stomach. 
 Heart size is normal.  Mediastinum is slightly widened, unchanged.  As
 compared to the prior study, there is slight interval improvement in
 widespread parenchymal opacities which are still present, substantially
 involving lungs bilaterally.  Sclerosis within the left humerus is most likely
 related to prior surgical treatment.  They might potentially reflect improving
 pulmonary edema, but attention to those areas to exclude the possibility of
 infectious process is recommended.
 
 As previously mentioned, the lower thoracic vertebral fractures can be seen on
 current examination.
