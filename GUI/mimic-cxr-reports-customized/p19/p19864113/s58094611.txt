                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia after MVC, status post bronchoscopy
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 11 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal, enteric, and left basilar chest tubes remain in unchanged
 positions.  Lung volumes remain low.  Heart size is moderately enlarged but
 likely exaggerated due to low lung volumes.  Widening of the superior
 mediastinal contour is unchanged.  There is improved aeration of the left lung
 with continued opacity in the retrocardiac region likely reflective of
 residual atelectasis.  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement is also likely
 present.  Aeration of the right lung base also appears slightly improved with
 residual atelectasis.  Known right-sided rib fractures are not well assessed
 on this exam.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval improvement in aeration of the left lung and right lung base
 with continued left basilar opacity, likely residual atelectasis.
