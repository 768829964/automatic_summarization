                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute hypoxic respiratory failure s/p trauma
 requiring ECMO support, now s/p decannulation with worsening hypoxemia.  //
 Eval for interval change.     Eval for interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there appears to be some
 increased bilateral opacification, worse on the right, consistent with pleural
 effusion and compressive atelectasis.  The change in appearance could reflect
 a more supine position of the patient.
 The monitor and support devices are essentially unchanged.
