 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess NG tube, patient with quadriplegia and pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 This is a very limited study, was centered in the thoracoabdominal region. 
 The apices of the lungs are not included.  NG tube tip is in the stomach. 
 Projection does not allow to evaluate the lungs, though there are persistent
 multifocal consolidations in the right lower lobe, left upper lobe, and left
 lower lobe with questionable increase in consolidation in the left lower lobe.
