                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with fever and shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of the same day
 at ___ a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal upright views of the chest were obtained.  Tracheostomy
 tube is in stable position.  Right subclavian central catheter terminates in
 the lower SVC.  Leads of a left chest wall pacer terminate over the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly is similar to prior,
 allowing for difference in patient position.  Retrocardiac opacity is stable
 and compatible with atelectasis, although infection may have a similar
 appearance.  Left lung volume loss is similar to prior.  No pneumothorax is
 visualized, though the patient's chin obscures the left apex.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate cardiomegaly with stable left lung volume loss. Stable
 retrocardiac opacity is compatible with atelectasis but may represent
 pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
