                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post bronchoscopy.  Patient with complete wipeout of
 the left lung.
 
 Comparison is made to prior studies performed a day earlier.
 
 Right lower lobe collapse is persistent.  Left upper lobe opacities and left
 lower lobe collapse are probably unchanged.  There is still some aeration in
 the left mid lung.  Right upper lung is grossly clear.  Small left pleural
 effusion is better seen in prior CT.  There is mild cardiomegaly.  Pacer leads
 are in standard position.  ET tube is in standard position.  NG tube is out of
 view below the diaphragm.  Right PICC tip is at the cavoatrial junction.
