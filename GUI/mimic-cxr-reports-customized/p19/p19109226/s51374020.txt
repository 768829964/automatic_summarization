                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Abdominal fluid collection, assess NG tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 NG tube tip is in the stomach.  Tracheostomy is seen in standard position. 
 Right central catheter tip is at the lower SVC.  Moderate-to-severe
 cardiomegaly is stable.  Transvenous pacemaker leads are in standard position.
 Bilateral pleural effusions, large on the left side, are stable.  Multifocal
 lung opacities in the upper lobes, larger on the left and lower lobes
 bilaterally, are grossly unchanged.  On the right, they have increased since
 ___.  They represent atelectasis and/or multifocal pneumonia.
