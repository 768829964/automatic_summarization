                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w HTN, DM, CAD s/p CABGx4, ESRD s/p renal tpx x 2admitted
 ___ w NSTEMI, CHF exacerbation, HCAP who presented with closed loop
 obstruction, now s/p exploratory laparotomy, extensive small bowel resection,
 currently in discontinuity  // Interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is somewhat rotated on today's study which limits assessment.  The
 endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are grossly unchanged in position.  The
 left-sided internal jugular catheter appears to terminate in the left
 brachiocephalic vein.  Previous median sternotomy noted with unchanged
 appearances of the sutures.  There is a hazy opacity at the right lung base
 consistent with a layering effusion.  Small left pleural effusion also seen. 
 Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, unchanged compared to the prior study. 
 Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  An apparent superior mediastinal
 mass is likely an artifact as this is related to tubing overlying the patient
 attention on followup recommended.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.
