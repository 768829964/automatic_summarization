                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with cp  // eval pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Increased opacity at the right lung base on the frontal is likely due to
 configuration of the diaphragm confirmed on the lateral.  There is however
 blunting of the posterior costophrenic angles and silhouetting of the left
 hemidiaphragm suggesting effusions with adjacent opacity likely component of
 associated atelectasis.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Median
 sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips are again noted.  No acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent opacity potentially
 atelectasis noting that infection is not excluded.
