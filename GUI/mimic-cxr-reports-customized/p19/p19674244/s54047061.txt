 As compared to the previous radiograph.  The position of the endotracheal tube
 is unchanged. The feeding tube appears to be partly coiled in the pharynx an
 should be repositioned.  The radiolucency of the lung bases has increased,
 likely reflecting improved ventilation.  The bilateral parenchymal opacities
 are still clearly visible but have decreased in extent and severity. Moderate
 cardiomegaly.  Decrease in extent of a pre-existing right pleural effusion.
