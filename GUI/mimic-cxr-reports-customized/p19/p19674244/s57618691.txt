 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is larger today, obscuring any abnormalities
 in the right lower lobe.  Left lower lobe remains densely consolidated,
 possibly atelectatic.  Moderate cardiomegaly and small left pleural effusion
 have also increased.  Left basal drainage catheter in either the chest or
 pericardium is unchanged in position.  New opacification in the midlung zones
 bilaterally is probably edema.
 
 Dual channel hemodialysis catheter ends in the right atrium.
