                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man w/ chronic hypoxic respiratory failure, HCAP, s/p
 left pigtail for pleural effusion, now on HD  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low which limits assessment.  A left-sided tunneled dialysis
 catheter is in-situ, unchanged in appearance when compared to the prior study.
 A tracheostomy in-situ.  A right-sided PICC terminates in the LS.  Pain in
 cell drain is in-situ small is unchanged in appearance when compared to the
 prior study there may be a small adjacent pneumothorax.  This area is
 difficult to evaluate.  There is persistent prominence of the pulmonary
 vasculature consistent with pulmonary vascular congestion.  Increased opacity
 is right noted in the right lower lung likely reflect a combination of both
 pleural effusion and atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible loculated pneumothorax at this site of the pigtail catheter.  This
 area is very difficult to evaluate.
