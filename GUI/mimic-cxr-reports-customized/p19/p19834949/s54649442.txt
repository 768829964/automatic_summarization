                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Meningitis, assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph; ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal contours and hilar contours are stable. There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Left basilar opacity is worsened on
 the current study.  Again seen is a rounded calcific density overlying the
 posterior third rib, likely a bone island.  ET tube has been withdrawn, now
 terminating approximately 7 cm above the carina.  Enteric tube is present with
 tip in the stomach pointing towards the pylorus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  ET tube terminating about 7 cm from the carina. 
 2.  Worsened left basilar opacity, which is consistent with aspiration or
 pneumonia in the correct clinical setting.
