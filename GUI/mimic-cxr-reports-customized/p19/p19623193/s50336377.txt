                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP UPRIGHT CHEST ___ AT 18:40 HOURS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been improved aeration of the lung bases with slight
 residual remaining in the retrocardiac left lower lobe.  Mild prominence of
 the pulmonary vasculature is evident and which may be in part indicative of
 underlying interstitial edema.  There has been prior median sternotomy.  The
 cardiac silhouette remains borderline enlarged but stable.  No definite
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild interstitial edema, likely cardiogenic in etiology. 
 Recommend repeat radiography after appropriate diuresis to assess for
 underlying infection.
