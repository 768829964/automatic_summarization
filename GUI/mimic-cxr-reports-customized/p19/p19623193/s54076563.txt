                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cardiac surgery with worsening shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, allowing for
 obliquity of the patient, there is probably little overall change.  Continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with evidence of pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Areas of opacification at the bases could reflect a developing
 consolidation, though they may merely be a manifestation of atelectasis and
 effusion in addition to the engorged pulmonary vessels.  Once again, a lateral
 radiograph would be most helpful.
