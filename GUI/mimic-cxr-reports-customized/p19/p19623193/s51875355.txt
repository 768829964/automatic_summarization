                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with hypoxemia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST:
 
 Nasogastric tube passes to the stomach.  A right IJ line extends to the
 cavoatrial junction.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is increased opacity at
 the left lung base, possibly in part reflecting increased atelectasis, though
 developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Aeration at the right lung base is
 also worsened, with new confluence laterally and obscuration of the
 diaphreagm.  Hilar contours are prominent, though unchanged.  The heart size
 is mildly enlarged, stable.  There is calcification of the aortic knob and
 descending aorta, while sternotomy wires and mediastinal surgical clips are in
 unchanged alignment.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increased opacity at the left and right lung bases,
 which could reflect developing pneumonia, though a component of this change on
 the left could also be accounted for by increased effusion and atelectasis. 
 Clinical correlation or consideration of PA and lateral radiographs is
 recommended.
