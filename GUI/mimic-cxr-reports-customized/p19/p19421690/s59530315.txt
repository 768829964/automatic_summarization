  study.  Two chest tubes are present.  An endotracheal tube is in unchanged
  position.  A right chest port terminates at or just below the root cavoatrial
  junction.  An endotracheal tube descends the thorax in uncomplicated course,
  its tip which projects over the right upper quadrant in the anticipated
  location of the gastric lumen.  Diffuse bilateral airspace opacities are
  unchanged.  Cardiac silhouette is stable.
