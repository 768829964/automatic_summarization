 WET READ: ___ ___ 7:47 PM
  1. Dobhoff courses below the diaphragm and partially out of view with tip
  likely in the stomach.  2. The right IJ catheter has been removed.  Otherwise
  stable position of multiple other support devices.  No pneumothorax.   3.
  Stable bibasilar opacities, likely a combination of pleural fluid and
  atelectasis.  Stable severe cardiomegaly.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 6:19 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Postoperative day 7 after ascending aortic repair.  Check Dobbhoff
 tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___ at 7:36 a.m.:
 
 Previous mild pulmonary edema has improved, but pulmonary vasculature is still
 engorged, and cardiomediastinal silhouette including mediastinal veins are
 still quite large.  A new feeding tube with a wire stylet in place passes
 below the diaphragm and out of view, and a loop of the catheter projecting
 over the left mandible is most likely external, but should be evaluated by
 direct inspection of the oropharynx.
 
 ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements respectively:
 
 Small right pleural effusion, severe left lower lobe atelectasis and left
 pleural effusion that is at least small are recently stable.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
