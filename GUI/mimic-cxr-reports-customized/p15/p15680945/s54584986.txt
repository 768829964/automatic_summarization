                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with multiple medical problems
 including a recent esophageal stricture which is status post dilatation. 
 Review of patient's record indicates right-sided lung transplantation in ___
 and more recent stenting of left main bronchus to keep airways open.
 
 PA and lateral chest views were obtained with the patient in upright position.
 Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___. 
 Overall, the chest findings appear stable.  Again noted is the moderate degree
 of mediastinal shift towards the right with lesser volume of the lung in the
 right hemithorax, apparently related to pulmonary transplant two decades ago. 
 The atelectatic appearing diffuse density in the apical area of the right lung
 appears unchanged.  Position of previously described left subclavian approach
 central venous line is unchanged, seen to terminate in the mid portion of the
 SVC.  No new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates have developed and the lungs
 are not congested vascularly.  As before, cholecystectomy clips in right upper
 quadrant and evidence of gastrostomy device to left of upper abdominal midline
 as before.  The lateral and posterior pleural sinuses remain free from any
 pleural effusion.  Skeletal structures of the thorax stable and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change since next preceding chest
 examination of ___.
