                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with left-sided lung transplant, new
 cough, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar study of ___.  Previously described atelectatic appearance of right apical lung
 with centrally located translucencies is unchanged.  The same holds for the
 previously described left subclavian central venous line seen to terminate in
 the mid portion of the SVC.  The left-sided hemithorax is carefully inspected
 and compared with the previous study.  The frontal view, one observes a more
 crowded appearance of the pulmonary vasculature and slightly more marked
 pulmonary parenchymal density that obliterates the diaphragmatic contour
 medially on the left side.  When comparison is extended to the lateral views,
 one observes likewise a slightly hazy density corresponding to the posterior
 segment of the left lung lobe.  There is, however, no evidence of any new
 pleural effusion obliterating the pleural sinuses and no pneumothorax is seen
 in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Comparison with the next previous similar study suggests
 development of a small hazy density in the left lower lobe posterior segment. 
 Noteworthy is that similar comparison between the preceding study of ___
 and examination of ___ did not demonstrate a similar interval change.
 
 It is therefore concluded that there is a new pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate
 of bronchopneumonic character in the left lower lobe posterior segment. 
 Followup examination after appropriate treatment is recommended in about one
 week.  There are no other significant interval changes identified.
