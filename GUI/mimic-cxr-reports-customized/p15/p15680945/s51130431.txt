                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent pneumonia in patient with right lung transplant.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the consolidation in the left mid
 to lower lung zone has substantially cleared.  However, there is some
 increased opacification in the right apical region, consistent with the
 history of right upper lobe atelectasis.  The possibility of supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
