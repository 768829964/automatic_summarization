                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory distress, intubated.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned, ending 3.9 cm
 above the level of the carina.  A left Port-A-Cath ends in the low SVC.  There
 is a stent in the left main bronchus.  A gastrostomy tube is redemonstrated
 along the left mid abdomen.  Surgical clips are seen in the right upper
 abdominal quadrant.  Dense consolidation at the right lung apex is increased
 compared to the prior radiograph from ___, but not significantly
 changed compared to CT from ___.  More heterogeneous opacities
 throughout the left mid-to-lower lung and at the right lung base are markedly
 increased compared to the prior radiograph from ___, but are also
 not significantly changed compared to prior CT from ___.  Aeration
 at the left lung apex is preserved.  Small bilateral pleural effusions were
 better seen on recent CT.  There is no pneumothorax.  The heart size is
 difficult to assess but was seen to be normal on prior CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No significant interval change and severe bilateral multifocal pneumonia
 when compared to CT from ___.  The degree of infection is markedly
 worse than on the prior radiograph from ___.
 
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions, better demonstrated on prior CT.  
 
 3.  Appropriately positioned lines and tubes.
