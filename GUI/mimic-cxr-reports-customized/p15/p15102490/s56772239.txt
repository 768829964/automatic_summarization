                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with tracheostomy and plan for external
 ventricular drain.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained.  Right
 basilar atelectasis has increased since yesterday's exam.  A curvilinear
 lucent line is newly noted at the right lung apex.  It is difficult to assess
 for lung markings beyond this line due to overlying rib shadows.  Tracheostomy
 tube remains in the upper trachea.  A left internal jugular catheter ends in
 the upper SVC.  Dual-chamber pacing leads project in unchanged positions.  A
 Dobbhoff tube is seen in the stomach.  A mitral valve ring is in unchanged
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased right basilar atelectasis.
 2.  Linear lucent line at the right lung apex.  These could represent a
 skinfold or less likely, a small pneumothorax.  A repeat chest radiograph is
 recommended for confirmation.  These findings were discovered at 9:40 a.m. on
 ___.  This finding was communicated with the team via phone, shortly
 thereafter.
