 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ET tube*** WARNING *** Multiple patients with
 same last name!  // ETT placement?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal semi-erect radiograph of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT ends 1 cm above the carina.  The NG tube extends below the diaphragm
 and out of view.  A right IJ venous sheath is in expected position.  There are
 bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar opacities.  There is fullness of
 the bilateral hila.  Low lung volumes are low with pulmonary edema.  There is
 an irregular lucency in the distal left clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ETT ends 1 cm above the carina.  Per the MICU note this is already been
 repositioned.
 2. Bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lung opacities which could
 reflect combination of effusion atelectasis and possibly superimposed
 pneumonia.
 3. Fullness of the bilateral hila could reflect vascular engorgement or
 potentially lymphadenopathy.
 4. Mild pulmonary edema.
 5. Irregular lucency in the distal clavicle could be related to prior trauma
 or metabolic disorder; however, a metastasis is also possible.  Depending on
 the workup of her abdominal findings, this could be further evaluated with CT
 if clinically indicated.
