                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with schizophrenia, diffuse large BCell
 lymphoma, decompensating overnight with hypotension  // ? aspiration
 pneumonia, volume overload, ?pleural effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___.
 CT chest with contrast ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with chest radiograph from ___, mild to moderate right
 effusion has improved and moderate left pleural effusion is minimally changed,
 if at all.  Left PICC line terminates in the low SVC.  Left retrocardiac
 opacity is probably unchanged.  There is vascular engorgement with mild
 pulmonary edema.  There is no other relevant change.  Upon review of prior
 studies, there is sufficient calcification in aortic valve to be
 hemodynamically significant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Moderate left effusion is minimally changed, if at all.
 2. Mild-to-moderate right effusion has improved.
 3. Vascular engorgement with mild pulmonary edema.
