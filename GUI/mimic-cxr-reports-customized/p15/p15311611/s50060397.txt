                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with flash pulmonary edema.  Eval for interval
 change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube tip projects 4.5 cm above the carina.  No change in the
 NG tube positioning.  Compared with the prior study, moderate left-sided
 pleural effusion has increased in size, with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
 Small right pleural effusion is still present.  There has been interval
 improvement in the bilateral multifocal opacities, suggesting they were likely
 due to pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval improvement in the degree of pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Increased left pleural effusion with adjacent left basilar atelectasis.
