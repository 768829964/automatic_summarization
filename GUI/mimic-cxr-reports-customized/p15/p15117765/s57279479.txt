                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with respiratory failure, intubated.  Study
 requested for assessment of ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  An ET tube terminates 3.4 cm above the carina, likely related to
 chin positioning.  Right IJ terminates in the mid SVC, unchanged from prior
 examination.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, the tip is not
 included in this examination.  A right PICC line is again seen terminating in
 the upper SVC. As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, the
 left lung is improved with increased aeration.  There is persistent
 obliteration of the left-sided hemidiaphragmatic contour however, suggestive
 of atelectasis.  Right lung remains unchanged.  There is no evidence of new
 pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates.  There is no definite pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 3.4 cm above the carina, likely related to
 chin positioning.
 
 2.  Improved aeration of the left lung.  Otherwise, unchanged pulmonary
 findings.
