                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, large volume ascites, left pleural effusion,
 evaluation of endotracheal tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged position
 of the endotracheal tube, with the tip projecting 4 cm above the carina.  The
 right PICC line is in constant position.  The course of the nasogastric tube
 is unremarkable, the tip is not visualized on the image.  In unchanged manner,
 there is complete opacification of the left hemithorax, likely caused by a
 combination of atelectasis and large pleural effusion.  The right lung is
 unremarkable on today's examination.
