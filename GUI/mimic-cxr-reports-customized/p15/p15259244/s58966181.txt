                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post Bentall and mitral valve
 vegetation removal, here to re-evaluate for pleural effusions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple preceding chest radiographs the most recent of which is
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position with the tip
 terminating 45 mm above the carina.  A left-sided PICC line is unchanged in
 position with the tip projecting over the cavoatrial junction.  A right
 internal jugular large-bore central catheter is unchanged in position with the
 tip terminating in the right atrium.  An OG tube is  in appropriate position. 
 Bilateral pleural pigtail catheters are unchanged in position in the lower
 lobes.  Increased opacification in the left lower lobe could be a combination
 of left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis or in the
 appropriate clinical setting, focal consolidation.  A small right-sided
 pleural effusion is stable with persistent opacity in the peripheral right
 lower lobe most likely atelectasis.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy with an atrial valve prosthesis consistent with Bentall procedure. 
 The mediastinal contours are stable.  The cardiac silhouette is severely
 enlarged with an apparent gradual increase in size from prior studies which is
 concerning for pericardial effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1)  Increased opacification of the left lower lobe is most likely a small
 left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis in this postoperative
 patient. 
 2)  Stable small right-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. 
 3)  Increased size of enlarged cardiac silhouette over multiple priors and
 when compared to baseline raises the possibility of pericardial effusion.
 
 Findings were communicated by Dr. ___ to ___ of cardiac
 surgery by phone at 12:55pm on ___.
