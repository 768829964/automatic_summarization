                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CHF, lethargy and hypotension.  Please assess for pneumonia or
 pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Bilateral moderate size pleural effusions are increased with increased
 interstitial markings and vascular congestion compatible with moderate to
 severe pulmonary edema.  Mid and lower lung right greater than left pulmonary
 opacities, may reflect atelectasis in this setting of effusions and pulmonary
 edema, however a in multifocal infectious process or aspiration cannot be
 excluded.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists unchanged.  Patient is status post
 median sternotomy and cardiac valve replacement.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate to severe congestive failure with bilateral moderate-sized pleural
 effusions, increased.  As these findings could mask an underlying infectious
 process, if clinical concern persists repeat imaging after diuresis is
 recommended.
