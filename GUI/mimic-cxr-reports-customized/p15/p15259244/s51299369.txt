                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after mitral valve
 annuloplasty and five bypass graft placements with closure of patent foramen
 ovale, assessment of the Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The Dobbhoff tip is malpositioned, continuing towards the right main bronchus.
 
 This position was corrected as demonstrated on the subsequent radiograph
 obtained 5 minutes later.
 
 The right internal and right subclavian central venous lines are in unchanged
 position, terminating at the level of superior SVC and right atrium
 respectively.  The replaced mitral valve is in expected position.  Severe
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The patient appears to be increased pulmonary
 edema as compared to the recent radiograph, associated with bilateral pleural
 effusions.
