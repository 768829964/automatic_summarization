                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with CHF and chronic kidney disease, evaluate for
 pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates an interval increase
 in size of a now moderate left pleural effusion with left basilar atelectasis.
 There is a smaller right pleural effusion with associated right basilar
 atelectasis.  Pulmonary edema is improved.  Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is
 unchanged, the mediastinal contours are normal.
 
 A right IJ catheter tip is unchanged projecting over the lower SVC.  Median
 sternotomy wires, and mitral valve prosthesis are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing left greater than right pleural effusions, represent
 residua of improved congestive heart failure.
