                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ESRD and hypotension.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is little overall change.  Again there is moderate pulmonary
 edema with probable bilateral effusions and substantial volume loss in the
 left lower lobe.  In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
