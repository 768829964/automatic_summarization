                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  A ___-year-old female with fever and immunosuppressive for
 pancreas and kidney transplant.
 
 COMPARISON:  PA and lateral chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Small bilateral pleural effusions improved on
 the right and increased on the left since the most recent prior examination of
 ___.  Increased opacification at the left lung base may represent
 underlying infection. Moderate-to-severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 is chronic and unchanged.  Bilateral low lung volumes are noted with crowding
 of bronchovascular markings.  A supraclavicular dialysis catheter ends in the
 right atrium. In the interim since the most recent prior examination, there
 has been removal of the left-sided PICC tip.  Sternotomy wires are midline and
 intact.  Patient is status post left mitral valve repair.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral pleural effusions, improved on the right compared to the prior
 examination, but worsened on the left. Increased opacification at the left
 lung base may represent underlying infection.
 2.  Low lung volumes with crowding of bronchovascular markings and minimal
 increased pulmonary vascular engorgement.
