                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Weakness and decreased blood sugar with leg swelling and tenderness.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post coronary artery bypass graft surgery and
 apparently mitral valve replacement.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is a slight
 interstitial abnormality, suggestive of a state of very mild congestion, but
 no new focal opacity.  A left-sided pleural effusion has resolved although
 mild scarring or atelectasis persists.  Bones are probably demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting mild pulmonary congestion.  Resolution of
 small left-side pleural effusion.
