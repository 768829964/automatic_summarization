                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Hypotension and dark fluid from peritoneal catheter.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post mitral valve replacement and probably
 coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is
 patchy basilar opacification suggesting a combination of atelectasis and
 pleural effusion.  Streaky left upper lobe opacity suggests minor atelectasis
 or scarring which is unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  No free air is
 demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Patchy left basilar opacity, highly suggestive of atelectasis in
 association with a small-to-moderate suspected pleural effusion, although
 opacification is not entirely specific as the etiology.
