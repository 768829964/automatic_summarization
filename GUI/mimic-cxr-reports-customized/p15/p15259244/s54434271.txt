 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  A left pleural

 underlying consolidation is difficult to exclude.  Patient is status post
 median sternotomy and CABG.  No definite focal consolidation is seen in the
 right lung.  The patient is status post median sternotomy and cardiac valve
 replacement.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis, underlying
 consolidation is difficult to exclude.
