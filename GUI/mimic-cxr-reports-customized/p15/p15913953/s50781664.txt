                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with desaturations, decreased BS on right?  // ?
 mucus plugging? atelectasis? pneumo
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to previous radiograph from earlier the same date, left lower
 lobe opacity has worsened, and a new opacification has developed at the right
 lung base.  Although potentially due to atelectasis, aspiration is an
 additional consideration.  Exam is otherwise remarkable for small bilateral
 pleural effusions.
