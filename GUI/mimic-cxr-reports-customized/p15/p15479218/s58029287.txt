 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube remains in place.  A right picc line ends at the origin of
 the SVC. A feeding tube terminates in the stomach. There is no pneumothorax. 
 Small right and moderate left pleural effusions with adjacent bibasilar
 airspace opacities are unchanged.  The lung parenchymal abscess or
 consolidation likely remains unresolved.  The heart and mediastinum cannot be
 accurately assessed on this projection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change since the study of 1 hr prior in small right
 and moderate left pleural effusions, and unresolved bibasilar airspace
 opacities.
