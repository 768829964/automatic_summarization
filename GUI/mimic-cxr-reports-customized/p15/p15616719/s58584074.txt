                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with retroperitoneal hematoma  // s/p L IJ CVL
 placement; s/p slight withdraw 2cm
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, the patient is in true AP position, without
 rotation.
 
 A left IJ central line is present.  Allowing for differences in patient
 rotation, left IJ line tip appears to been retracted slightly compared with
 the prior film.  It now lies slightly to the left of the expected site of
 confluence of the left brachiocephalic and right subclavian veins.  It does
 not clearly reach the SVC.  The opacity in the expected location of the
 azygous vein measures approximately 6.6 mm, larger than a normal azygos vein.
 
 Overall, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar and hazy opacities in
 both bases are also similar.  As before, the right hemidiaphragm is partially
 obscured and there is dense increased retrocardiac density.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution and mild vascular plethora.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 ET tube and NG tube again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 On the current examination, the left IJ line lies slightly proximal to the
 expected site of confluence of the right subclavian and left brachiocephalic
 veins and does not appear to reach the SVC.  No pneumothorax detected.
