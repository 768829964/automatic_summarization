                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pnemonia  // acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13 10
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is an ET tube, tip at the level of the mid clavicular heads, 4.8 cm
 from the carina.  The NG tube tip extends beneath the diaphragm off the film. 
 Also again seen is a right IJ line, tip overlying the mid SVC. Clips are again
 noted over the upper mediastinum.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is vascular plethora,
 diffuse vascular blurring, and minimal fluid in the minor fissure, consistent
 with CHF.  Hazy opacity over both lung bases likely represents layering
 bilateral layering pleural effusions, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.
 
 Compared with 1 day earlier, the right hemidiaphragm is obscured, likely
 reflecting an increase in the right pleural effusion and underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.  Otherwise, doubt significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 CHF with bilateral effusions and bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation. 
 Interval obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm could reflect a small increase
 in right pleural fluid and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 Otherwise doubt significant interval change.
