                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:30 P.M. ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  Acute on chronic respiratory failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___: 
 
 Right lung is clear.  Left hemidiaphragm is chronically elevated, explaining
 persistent left basal atelectasis.  Whether the left hemidiaphragm is
 functional would require observation with chest fluoroscopy or ultrasound.
 
 The tracheostomy tube is in standard placement, but the trachea looks
 generally narrow as confirmed on the chest CT ___, which showed marked
 narrowing and tracheal wall thickening.  This could contribute to respiratory
 insufficiency.  Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic.  
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 9 a.m. following recognition of the findings.
