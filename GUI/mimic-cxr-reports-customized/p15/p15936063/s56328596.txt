 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Tracheostomy is in place with its tip approximately 9 cm above the carina.

 opacities most likely due to combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion. 
 Infectious process in this area cannot be entirely excluded.  No pneumothorax
 is seen.
