                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with chronic respiratory failure with acute
 hypoxia.  Assess for pulmonary edema, pneumonia or mucus plugging.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple prior radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph was provided.  Tracheostomy tube
 is in appropriate position. The trachea is narrowed as seen previously.  A
 right PICC line has been removed.  Compared to the prior radiographs, there is
 no significant change in the appearance of the lungs.  Again seen is a left
 basilar opacity with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm which may represent
 a combination of atelectasis and effusion.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.
 There is no pneumothorax.  There are aortic valvular calcifications.  The
 heart is unchanged in size.  Bones are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Overall, no significant change with left basilar opacity which
 may represent a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion.
