                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intracranial bleed with tracheostomy and bilateral pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Continued opacification at the left base reflects soie combination of
 pleural fluid, atelectasis, and pneumonia.  Remainder of the lungs show no
 evidence of consolidation.  Stable mild cardiomegaly without evidence of
 vascular congestion or right effusion.
 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in place.
