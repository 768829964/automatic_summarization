                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 19:17
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with desaturation.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film of ___ at 19:17 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There is persistent left hemidiaphragmatic elevation with adjacent patchy
 opacity which may reflect compressive atelectasis, although aspiration should
 also be considered.  There is blunting of the costophrenic angle, likely
 reflecting a pleural effusion or chronic pleural thickening.  The vasculature
 is less well defined which likely represents mild interstitial edema.  The
 heart remains enlarged.  The aorta is calcified consistent with
 atherosclerosis.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.
