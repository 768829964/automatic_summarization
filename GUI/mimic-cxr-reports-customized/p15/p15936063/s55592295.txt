                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with remote CVA and chronic pleural effusion who
 has increased temp and reported increased yellow secretions  // assess for
 pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for technical differences, there is negligible interval change
 compared with ___.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is again noted. Again seen are bilateral
 right-greater-than-left effusions, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation; prominent but unchanged cardiomediastinal silhouette; and CHF.
 No new area of infiltrate is identified.
 
 Unusual curvilinear lucency at the right lung apex medially is noted, ? 
 Artifact due to projection. A small pneumothorax is considered less likely.
 Attention to this area on followup films is requested.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No new infiltrate identified. Bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation
 remains present and the possibility of an associated pneumonic infiltrate
 cannot be entirely excluded.
 2. Curvilinear lucency at right lung apex medially -- question artifact or,
 less likely, a small pneumothorax. Attention to this area on followup films is
 requested.
