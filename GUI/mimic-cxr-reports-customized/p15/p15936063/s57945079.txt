 COMPARISON:  PRIOR CHEST RADIOGRAPHS SINCE ___, MOST RECENTLY
 ___ AT 09:09.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large multiloculated right hydro pneumothorax, increased since ___,
 probably stable since earlier in the day.  An apical component of chronic
 right pneumothorax is unchanged since ___, however a large basal component

 function of pleural restriction, since it corresponds to the previous contour
 of the lung when only pleural fluid was present in the lower chest.  .
 
 The sequence of events suggests the development of a bronchopleural fistula.
 
 Small left pleural effusion or pleural scarring is unchanged since ___. 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable.
