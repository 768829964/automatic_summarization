 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hemorrhagic stroke in ___
 with altered mental status and fever, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies dated ___ at 8:23.
 
 A portable upright chest film ___ at 14:42 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There is a stable moderate-sized left pleural effusion with associated
 patchy opacity which may reflect compressive atelectasis, although
 superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.  The right lung appears grossly
 clear, although somewhat diminished in volume when compared to the previous
 study.  Heart remains enlarged.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or
 pneumothorax.  Left subclavian PICC line in place with the catheter being
 visualized to the level of the left brachiocephalic vein, but the tip cannot
 be definitively seen.  A tracheostomy tube remains in position, although the
 overall trachea appears somewhat small in caliber but unchanged.  No
 pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
