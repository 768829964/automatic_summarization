                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ at 12:21.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated with feeding tube coiled in back
 of throat, assess nasogastric tube placement.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 4:25.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 12:21 is submitted.  The right
 lateral thorax is not entirely included on the study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Left subclavian central line has its tip in the proximal SVC, unchanged. 
 There is a Dobbhoff feeding tube which has its tip within the stomach but just
 below the gastroesophageal junction.  It may be prudent to advance the tube
 somewhat to be sure that it is not near the GE junction.  The endotracheal
 tube now appears to lie approximately 7 cm above the carina but this may be
 related to the lordotic technique on the current examination. Consolidation at
 the left lung base may represent an area of pneumonia with associated pleural
 effusion, less likely atelectasis given the lack of interval change.  There is
 pulmonary venous hypertension with a suggestion of some superimposed mild
 interstitial edema.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely
 unchanged given marked patient rotation on the current examination.
