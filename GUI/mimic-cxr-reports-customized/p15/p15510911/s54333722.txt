                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F, PMH of anxiety/depression presenting after MVC versus tree
 sustaining multiple injuries, including C6-7 transverse process fracture
 associated with hematoma, right ICA dissection, bilateral PTX with extensive
 RUL pulmonary contusions/lacerations s/p bilateral pigtail placement, C7-T3
 spinous process fractures, T1-6 transverse process fractures, right 2nd rib
 head fracture, IVH with layering in dependent ___ ventricle, liver I, IV, V
 lacerations, extensive R facial laceration s/p repair by Plastics and right
 mid clavicle fracture.  // interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 951 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube tip lies above the level of the clavicles, relatively high. NG tube 
 extends beneath the diaphragm off the film.  The tube tip seen in the left
 upper quadrant of the abdomen likely represents the tip of the looped NG tube,
 but should be correlated clinically.  Left subclavian central line tip
 overlies the middle/distal SVC.  Bilateral pigtail-type catheters are seen at
 both lung bases.
 
 The patient is rotated, but note is made of a small left apical pneumothorax,
 improved compared with ___.  No obvious right apical pneumothorax,
 though the film is labeled as supine.
 
 There is increased retrocardiac density, consistent left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation, which has increased slightly compared with the prior
 film.  A hazy opacity in the right upper zone has improved.  Elsewhere, the
 lungs are grossly clear.  No CHF.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.
 
 The patient's right midclavicular fracture is again noted.  There are multiple
 known lower cervical/upper thoracic spine fractures, which are not well
 depicted on this examination.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as described.  ET tube above the level of the clavicles.  NG
 tube presumably loops in the upper abdomen, but should be correlated
 clinically to exclude the presence of a separate additional tube in the upper
 abdomen.
 
 Left lobe collapse and/or consolidation again seen, slightly worse than on
 ___ at 09:52
 
 Small left apical pneumothorax, slightly improved.
 
 Hazy opacity previously seen in the right upper zone slightly improved and
 nearly completely resolved.
