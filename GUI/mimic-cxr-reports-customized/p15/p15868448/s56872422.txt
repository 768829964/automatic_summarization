                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 614 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with VAP and fever.  Evaluate for change.
 
 Comparison to prior study ___ at ___. 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 6:14 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy tube, nasogastric tube and right internal jugular central
 line are unchanged in position.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  Lung volumes remain low and there are patchy streaky opacities at
 both bases associated with layering pleural fluid likely reflecting
 atelectasis rather than a pneumonia, although clinical correlation would be
 advised.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
