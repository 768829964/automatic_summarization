                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, history of TB
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest ___, chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy.  Cardiac silhouette size is
 mildly enlarged and unchanged in configuration.  Calcified mediastinal lymph
 nodes are re- demonstrated compatible prior granulomatous disease. 
 Calcification of the pericardium is also re- demonstrated.  The mediastinum
 remains widened compatible with underlying lymphadenopathy and fluid. 
 Moderate pulmonary edema appears worse.  Moderate size bilateral pleural
 effusions appear slightly increased in size compared to the previous
 radiograph.  Consolidative opacities in the lung bases appear worse in the
 interval.  A right sided chest tube is again noted with tip projecting over
 the medial aspect of the right mid lung.  No pneumothorax is identified. 
 Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Worsening moderate pulmonary edema.
 2. Increased size of moderate bilateral pleural effusions with right chest
 tube in place.  No definite pneumothorax.
 3. Widening of the mediastinum likely due to underlying lymphadenopathy and
 fluid.  Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes compatible with prior granulomatous
 disease.
 4. Worsening consolidative opacities in the lung bases which may reflect
 atelectasis and/ or infection.
