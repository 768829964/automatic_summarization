 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right internal jugular large bore catheter and right subclavian PICC line are
 unchanged in position.  Tracheostomy tube is in satisfactory position. 
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  The diffuse bilateral
 airspace process is stable and could represent pulmonary edema or a diffuse
 infectious process.  Clinical correlation is recommended.  There are several
 calcified mediastinal lymph nodes suggestive of prior granulomatous infection.
 No obvious pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is
 diminished given supine technique.
