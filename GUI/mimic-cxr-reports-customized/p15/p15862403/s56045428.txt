                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of nasogastric tube placement in a patient with
 hypoxia and pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP supine view of the chest was reviewed.  The lateral
 aspect of the right chest was excluded.  A tracheostomy ends 5 cm above the
 carina.  Right-sided hemodialysis catheter and PICC line end in the mid
 superior vena cava.  The upper enteric tube enters the stomach and ends off of
 the radiograph.  Increased vascular volume and an interval increase in
 moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema reflect volume overload or biventricular
 heart failure.  Median sternotomy wires are aligned and intact.  Lung volumes
 are low and there are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax. Top normal heart
 size is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Upper enteric tube enters the stomach and ends off of the radiograph.
 
 2.  Increased moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema and increased vascular volume
 could be caused by volume overload or biventricular heart failure.
