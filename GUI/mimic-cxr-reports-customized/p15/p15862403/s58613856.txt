                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with hypoxemia, probable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___, to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Tracheostomy and right-sided PICC line are in adequate position.  New
 right-sided hemodialysis catheter ends in the lower SVC.  The lung volumes are
 lower and new bibasilar opacities, left more than right, is mainly explained
 by atelectasis.  Superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Pleural effusions are small, if any.  Diffuse
 ground-glass opacities in both lungs which could be a mix of pulmonary edema
 and pneumonia are unchanged.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 New bibasilar opacities, left more than right, are probably explained by
 atelectasis.  Superimposed infection or aspiration cannot be excluded in
 appropriate clinical setting.
