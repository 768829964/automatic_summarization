 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:29 AM
  1. Moderate pulmonary edema with stable moderate cardiomegaly and increased
  small left pleural effusion.
  2. In order to exclude pneumonia a repeat PA and lateral chest radiograph once
  the edema has resolved should be considered as current underlying parenchymal
  disease limits evaluation.
  3. A right PICC tip is seen at least up to the low SVC.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 1:57 AM
  1. Moderate pulmonary edema with stable moderate cardiomegaly and increased
  small left pleural effusion.
  2.  Retrocardiac opacity likely represents combination of asymmetric pulmonary
  edema and pleural effusion, however pneumonia cannot be excluded in the
  appropriate clinical setting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD, CHF hypotension, shortness of
 breath.  Assess for pneumonia, CHF exacerbation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated with crowding of vasculature. There is progression
 of severe vascular engorgement with peribronchial cuffing as well as bilateral
 perihilar opacities with interval increase in small left pleural effusion.  No
 right pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.
 
 A right PICC tip is seen at least up to the low SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate pulmonary edema with stable moderate cardiomegaly and increased
 small left pleural effusion.
 2.  In order to exclude pneumonia a repeat PA and lateral chest radiograph
 once the edema has resolved should be considered as current underlying
 parenchymal disease limits evaluation.
 3.  A right PICC tip is seen at least up to the low SVC.
