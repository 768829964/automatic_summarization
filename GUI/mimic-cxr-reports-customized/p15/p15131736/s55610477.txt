                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia in a patient with dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes, with
 exaggeration of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular crowding.  Even
 allowing for this, there is at least moderate cardiomegaly.  Bilateral
 opacities are likely related sella mild to moderate vascular congestion and
 pulmonary edema, as well as atelectasis.  This is similar to slightly
 increased compared to ___.  Dense retrocardiac consolidation is
 likely related to edema, but superimposed consolidation cannot be excluded. 
 There is no appreciable pneumothorax.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate vascular congestion and pulmonary edema.  Possible bilateral
 pleural effusions with atelectasis.  Retrocardiac opacity which may be due in
 part to pulmonary edema and atelectasis limits evaluation of the left lower
 lung, and superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.
