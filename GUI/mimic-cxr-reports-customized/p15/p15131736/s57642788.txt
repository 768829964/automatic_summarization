 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph was taken.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___, ___ and ___.  .
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hypoinflated.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  There is
 pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema.  A left retrocardiac
 opacity likely reflects pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis.  An
 underlying left basilar consolidation cannot be excluded.  Calcifications are
 noted along the aortic arch.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Congestive heart failure with cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema.
 2. Probable left pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis, though an
 underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
