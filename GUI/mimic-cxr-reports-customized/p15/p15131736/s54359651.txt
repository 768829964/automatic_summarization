                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with COPD, OSA, pulmonary edema, and
 hypoventilation syndrome, now with hypoxia and somnolence.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Moderate-to-severe chronic cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  The lung volumes are extremely low resulting in crowding of the
 bronchovascular markings.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present, with
 improvement in the previously seen pulmonary edema. No consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen in this study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Pulmonary vascular congestion, with improved edema.
