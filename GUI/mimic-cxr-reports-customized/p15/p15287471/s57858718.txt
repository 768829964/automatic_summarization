                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with respiratory failure, bilateral effusions, evaluation
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube ends 3.7 cm above carina.  The feeding tube is in adequate
 position below the diaphragm.  Left-sided PICC line is in mid SVC.  Bilateral
 moderate pleural effusion with bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.  Right
 upper lobe decreased opacity could reflect improvement of the lung process
 versus modification in ventilation parameters.  Pulmonary edema is mild to
 moderate and unchanged.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.  There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tube and lines are in adequate position.
 2.  Slight improvement in right upper lobe opacity.  This could reflect
 improvement of the lung process versus change in ventilation parameters.
 3.  Moderate pleural effusions are unchanged.
