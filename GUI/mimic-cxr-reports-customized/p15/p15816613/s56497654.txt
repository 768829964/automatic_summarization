                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 332 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pleural effusion, to assess for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 645.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 333 is submitted. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left dual-lead pacer remains in place with the lead terminating over the
 expected location of the right atrium and right ventricle, respectively. 
 There is prominent calcification of the aortic knob and descending aorta
 consistent with atherosclerosis.  The heart remains stably enlarged.  There is
 persistent essentially unchanged layering and bilateral effusions and patchy
 airspace disease in both lungs suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema,
 although diffuse pneumonia could also have this appearance.  Clinical
 correlation is advised. Asymmetric left apical thickening is again seen and
 may reflect loculated fluid. No pneumothorax is appreciated.
