                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Pigtail pleural catheter remains in place in the lower left
 hemithorax, with apparent increase in moderate loculated left pleural effusion
 laterally.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Multifocal bilateral
 consolidation remains most severe in the central juxtahilar regions, and has
 slightly worsened in the interval.  More peripheral interstitial opacities
 have also progressed, and a small-to-moderate right pleural effusion has
 slightly increased in size.
