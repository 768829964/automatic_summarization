                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with ET tube placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with comparison to prior study
 obtained a day earlier.
 
 The ET tube, the NG tube and the right PICC line are in unchanged position as
 well as the pacemaker leads.  There is minimal improvement in widespread
 parenchymal consolidations and bilateral pleural effusions.  The findings are
 most likely consistent with multifocal pneumonia associated with large right
 and smaller, but loculated left pleural effusion as better depicted on the
 chest CT obtained on ___.
