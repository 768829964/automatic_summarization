                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral pigtail pleural catheters remain in place.  Persistent
 loculated left basilar pneumothorax, with decrease in left pleural effusion
 noted.  Small right pleural effusion has decreased since ___
 radiograph at ___.  There is no visible right pneumothorax.  Large rounded
 opacity in left juxtahilar region appears to correspond to loculated pleural
 fluid on recent CT of ___.  Additional loculated area of pleural
 fluid is present at left apex, similar in appearance to recent radiograph. 
 Overall improved aeration at left lung base.  Worsening heterogeneous
 opacification in right perihilar and basilar regions, possibly representing
 asymmetrical pulmonary edema, but aspiration and evolving infection are also
 possible.
