                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with ischemic bowel.  Assess NG tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 22:38 and subsequent
 chest radiograph from ___ at 12:01 a.m.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-SUPINE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A nasointestinal catheter is
 coiled in the region of the neck, and then terminates in the region of the
 right lower lobe bronchus.  Followup radiograph on ___ shows that the
 catheter has been repositioned with the tip in the stomach.  A pacemaker
 generator and leads appear in expected unchanged position.  The lung volumes
 are low, though no confluent consolidation is identified.  There is no
 pulmonary edema or large pleural effusions.  The right costophrenic angle is
 excluded from the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Malpositioned nasointestinal catheter with the tip projecting over the
 right lower lobe bronchus.  Subsequent radiograph shows repositioning, with
 the tip in the stomach.
 
 2.  Low lung volumes, though no acute cardiopulmonary process.
