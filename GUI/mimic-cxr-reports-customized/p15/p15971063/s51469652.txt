                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Transferred from outside hospital for massive intracranial
 hemorrhage.
 
 COMPARISON: None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable view of the chest demonstrates an endotracheal tube
 in appropriate position, terminating 6 cm above the level of the carina.  An
 NG tube is also seen coursing through the esophagus, into the stomach, and out
 of view.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.  A small amount of
 opacification in the left lung base likely represents aspiration.  There is no
 pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lung base hazy opacification, likely aspiration.  Monitoring
 and support devices in appropriate position.
