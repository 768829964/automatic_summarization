                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p cardiac arrest with hypoxia  // s/p cardiac
 arrest
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___
 CTA chest, abdomen, and pelvis from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since earlier same day chest radiograph, mild pulmonary edema is slightly
 worse, bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right and small on the
 left, are unchanged, and bibasilar atelectasis, right greater than left, are
 increased.  Lucency in right upper quadrant of the abdomen is potentially
 projectional, although free air or basilar pneumothorax may produce a similar
 appearance.
 
 Severe cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Known rib deformities are again noted.  Tip
 of the endotracheal tube is seen 2.3 cm above the carina.  A feeding tube is
 seen in the stomach and can be advanced further.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema, bilateral pleural effusions, accompanied by with
 worsening bibasilar atelectasis and small pleural effusions.
 2. Right upper quadrant lucency may be projectional, but basilar pneumothorax
 or free intraperitoneal air could have a similar radiographic presentation. 
 Left lateral decubitus radiograph may be helpful for further evaluation.  .
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  If clinically indicated, further imaging could be obtained
 with a left lateral decubitus chest radiograph to better evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___
 ___ on the telephoneon ___ at 11:18 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
