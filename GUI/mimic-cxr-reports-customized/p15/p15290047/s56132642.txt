 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the current examination is
 again somewhat limited.  There is substantial large min of the cardiac
 silhouette with prominent pulmonary edema that appears to be increasing. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions and compressive basilar atelectasis are also seen.
 The possibility of superimposed pneumonia can certainly not be excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
