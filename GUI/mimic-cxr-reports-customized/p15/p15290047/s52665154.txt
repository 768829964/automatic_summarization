                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ETT  // ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since ___, bilateral multifocal opacities appear worse and may
 represent increasing pulmonary edema.  However, concurrent multifocal
 pneumonia is not excluded.  Bilateral pleural effusions, moderate to large on
 the right and small on the left, and associated bibasilar atelectasis are
 increased.  Lung volumes remain low.  The tip of an endotracheal tube
 terminates 2.5 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is seen in the stomach and
 continues out of view.  No pneumothorax.
