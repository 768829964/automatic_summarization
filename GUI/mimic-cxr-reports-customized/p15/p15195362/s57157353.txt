  No change in lung volumes.  Dobbhoff tube has been advanced, now fully within
  the stomach.  Right lower lobe collapse is stable.  The mediastinum is
  unchanged.  The tip of the tracheostomy tube is directed towards the left
  tracheal wall, as before.

 COMPARISON CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of the tracheostomy tube has a lateral orientation directed to
 the left of midline.  However, this is difficult to assess in the setting of
 rightward patient rotation.  Diffuse mediastinal widening consistent with
 known thyroid mass appears unchanged, and cardiac silhouette is stable as
 well.  Within the lungs, widespread pulmonary metastases are again
 demonstrated as well as persistent right lower lobe atelectasis and/or
 consolidation.  Improved aeration at left lung base.  No change in small right
 pleural effusion.  Feeding tube has been advanced in the interval, now
 terminating in the body of the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Advancement of feeding tube, now terminating in the stomach.
 
 2.  Large thyroid mass and widespread pulmonary metastases in keeping with
 history of metastatic thyroid cancer.
