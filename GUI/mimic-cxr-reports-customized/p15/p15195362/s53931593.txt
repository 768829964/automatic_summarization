                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tracheal stent for thyroid mass, now with hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is
 essentially no change.  Large thyroid mass is again seen and there is again
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular congestion. 
 Hemidiaphragms are not sharply seen, suggesting possible effusions and
 compressive atelectasis at the bases, though this appearance may merely be a
 manifestation of scattered radiation related to the size of the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little change.
