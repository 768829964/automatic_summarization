                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:16 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with follicular thyroid carcinoma after
 thyroidectomy, now with a tracheostomy.  New secretions.  Evaluate for right
 lower lobe abnormality.
 
 Atelectasis at the base of the right lung has probably increased since ___.  There could also be a small right pleural effusion, but there is no
 pneumonia or pulmonary edema.  Heart is chronically moderately to severely
 enlarged and a large mass in the mediastinum displaces the trachea to the left
 and extends inferiorly from the thoracic inlet to the right tracheobronchial
 angle.  Vascular congestion is seen in the left lung, but no other focal
 abnormality is present.
