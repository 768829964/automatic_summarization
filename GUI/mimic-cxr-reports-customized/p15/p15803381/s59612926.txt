                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, hypoxia, and weakness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, most recently from ___. 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a moderate left pleural effusion, similar to multiple recent studies.
 Left basilar opacification is similar to the prior exam, likely atelectasis,
 but infection cannot be excluded. There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion
 and cardiomegaly.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, cardiomegaly, and a moderate left pleural
 effusion.  Persistent left basilar opacification may reflect compressive
 atelectasis but infection is not excluded.
