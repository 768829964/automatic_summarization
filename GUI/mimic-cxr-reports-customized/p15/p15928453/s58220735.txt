                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT 8:17
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with small bowel resection, C. diff colitis
 with iatrogenic apical right pneumothorax, check pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest ___ at 8:17 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 A right pleural pigtail catheter remains in place.  A moderate-sized right
 pneumothorax is again seen, which has slightly decreased in size since the
 prior study.  There is no pulmonary edema or focal airspace consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.  Minimal blunting the left costophrenic angle either
 reflects a small effusion or thickening.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  Rounded opacity seen on the lateral projection,
 projecting just posterior one of the mid to lower thoracic vertebrae, most
 likely represents superimposed shadows given the absence of a pulmonary nodule
 on the recent CT study of ___.  No acute bony abnormality.
