                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent ventilator-associated pneumonia, ex lap and bowel
 resection, now with fever, here to evaluate for pneumonia or intra-abdominal
 free air.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left PICC is in place with the tip terminating at the cavoatrial
 junction.  The lungs are symmetrically well expanded and well aerated.  There
 is an ill-defined airspace opacity projecting over the left mid lung zone,
 which is decreased from the prior study. The left lung base is better aerated.
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Biapical scarring appears
 symmetrical.  There is no overt pulmonary edema.  The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  There is no free air beneath the
 right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Focal airspace opacity in the right mid lung most likely represents
 residual/resolving infection.
 2.  No evidence of free air.
