                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with tracheostomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube has been removed and a new tracheostomy ends 4 cm above the carina. 
 Left-sided PICC line is at the cavoatrial junction.  NG tube has been removed.
 Left lower lobe consolidation is stable since ___.  New moderate
 loculated fluid is in right minor fissure.  There is also a new area of
 increased density in the right lower lung with a focal radiolucency centrally.
 It is indeterminate if it is a atypical pleural effusion versus a pneumonia or
 aspiration.  Cavitary or necrotizing process cannot be excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac contour is top normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  New tracheostomy is in adequate position.
 2.  New moderate right loculated pleural fluid is in the minor fissure.
 3.  New increased density in right lower lung with a central lucency.  This
 could be an atypical distribution of pleural effusion; however, a necrotizing
 pneumonia is not excluded. A short term followup is suggested, and if
 persistent, a CT scan could be done.  
 
 This was discussed with the resident in the ICU team.
