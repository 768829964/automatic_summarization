                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 527 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post spinal cord injury, trach with
 pneumonia.  Evaluate for progression.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 432.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 527 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian PICC line and tracheostomy tube are unchanged in position.
 There continues to be confluent opacity in the left infrahilar region.  Given
 differences in positioning, it is likely not significantly changed and could
 reflect an area of acute aspiration or developing pneumonia.  Followup imaging
 may be helpful.  The right lung is grossly clear.  There are bilateral old mid
 clavicular fractures.  No evidence of pulmonary edema, pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax.  Hardware is seen overlying the lower visualized cervical spine
 with skin ___ suggesting recent surgery.  Cardiac contour is stable.
 Mediastinal contours are unchanged.
