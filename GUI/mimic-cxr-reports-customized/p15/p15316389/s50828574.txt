                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Large SAH status post EVD, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 16:14 p.m.
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy, with mediastinal clips.  As before,
 there is interruption of the third from top sternal wire.  An ET tube is
 present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 3.9 cm above the carina. 
 A right IJ central line is present, tip over proximal SVC.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  
 
 Heart size is at the upper limits of normal.  There is patchy opacity at the
 left base, in the setting of an elevated left hemidiaphragm.  The degree of
 retrocardiac density has increased, raising the question of left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.  No gross effusion identified.  Aside from
 minimal subsegmental basal atelectasis, the right lung is grossly clear
 without CHF, focal consolidation, or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lines and tubes in satisfactory position.
 
 2.  Status post sternotomy, with interruption of the third from top sternal
 wire.  Clinical correlation is requested.  
 
 3.  Increased retrocardiac density, worse compared with one day earlier,
 raising the question of left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Note
 is made that the left hemidiaphragm is elevated.
