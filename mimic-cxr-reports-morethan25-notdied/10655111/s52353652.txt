                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ETT  // Interval change?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous study from 1 day earlier, a large subcutaneous gas
 collection in the right chest wall appears more prominent than on the prior
 study, but this region was incompletely imaged on the prior exam, limiting
 comparison.  Exam is otherwise similar to the prior study except for a
 developing area of opacification at the right lung base, which could be due to
 atelectasis, aspiration, or asymmetrical edema.  No other relevant changes.
