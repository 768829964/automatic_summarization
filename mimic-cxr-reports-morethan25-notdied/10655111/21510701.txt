                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with trach s/p bronch  // interval change
 post-bronch
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the prior radiograph, the patient is positioned differently. 
 The patient is upright as opposed to semi-upright previously and more rotated
 to the right.  There is increased atelectasis at the left base.  Increased
 diffuse opacification of the right lung may represent a layering effusion or
 increased edema within that lung.  A moderate right  pleural effusion has
 redistributed but probably stable in size. Tracheostomy tube and right PICC
 are unchanged in position.  Heart size is difficult to evaluate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comparison is difficult due to changes in positioning.  Left lower lung
 atelectasis has increased.  Diffuse opacification of the right hemothorax may
 be related to an increased layering effusion or new parenchymal process.
