                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 2:30 p.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen
 is left IJ PICC line with tip over mid SVC and a NG type tube, similar to the
 prior study where it did appear to extend beneath the diaphragm.  
 
 Again seen is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with obscuration
 of the left hemidiaphragm and possible associated small amount of left pleural
 fluid.  Also again seen is patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region. 
 Mild vascular plethora is similar to the prior film as well.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Doubt significant interval change compared to one day earlier.
