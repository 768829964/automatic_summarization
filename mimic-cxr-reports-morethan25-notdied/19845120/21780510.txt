                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Tachypnea, shortness of breath, evaluation for pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, lung volumes have slightly
 increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation.  An atelectasis seen
 on the previous image, located at the right lung base, is no longer visible. 
 The atelectasis in the retrocardiac lung region is constant in appearance.
