                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval removal of right internal jugular vascular catheter with
 no visible pneumothorax.  Stable cardiomegaly.  Slight improved aeration at
 right lung base, but no appreciable change in left retrocardiac opacity with
 adjacent small left pleural effusion.  Small right pleural effusion extending
 into the minor fissure appears unchanged.
