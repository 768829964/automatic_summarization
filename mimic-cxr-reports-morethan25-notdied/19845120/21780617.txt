 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Fluid overload, followup.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 03:55 a.m.
 
 The ET tube, the NG tube and the right internal jugular line are in unchanged
 position.  There is interval minimal improvement in pulmonary edema.  Large
 bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  Mediastinal widening is
 redemonstrated, at least in part explained by pulmonary hypertension.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Bibasal consolidations cannot be excluded.
