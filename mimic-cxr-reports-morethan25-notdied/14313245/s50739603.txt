 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices remain in standard
 position.  Lower lung volumes compared to the prior study with associated
 accentuation of the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular structures. 
 Rapidly worsening right lower lobe opacity favors either atelectasis or
 aspiration.  Improving aeration in left lower lobe, particularly in the
 retrocardiac area.
