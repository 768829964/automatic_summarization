                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with large subarachnoid
 hemorrhage after angiography and coiling, for assessment of the NG tube
 placement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior radiograph
 obtained the same day earlier.
 
 The NG tube tip is in the distal esophagus and should be repositioned.  There
 is interval improvement in the right upper lobe atelectasis with still present
 opacity.  The heart size in left of the mediastinum appears unchanged.  There
 is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax currently demonstrated.
 
 The ET tube tip is 6.8 cm above the carina.
