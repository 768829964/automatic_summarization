                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  An
 endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 5.7 cm above the level of
 carina.  There is streaky right upper lobe opacity which may be due to partial
 collapse of the right upper lobe with possible underlying aspiration.  If
 there has been trauma, underlying contusion is not excluded.  There are
 overall low lung volumes.  The left lung is clear.  There is no large pleural
 effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal. 
 The superior mediastinum is mildly prominent.  If there is clinical concern
 for a chest injury, chest CTA would provide further evaluation.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminates 5.7 cm above the level of the carina.
 2.  Streaky right upper lobe opacity with loss of volume in the right upper
 lobe, underlying aspiration or contusion not excluded.
 3.  Prominence of the superior mediastinum, if clinical concern for chest
 injury, chest CTA is more sensitive.
