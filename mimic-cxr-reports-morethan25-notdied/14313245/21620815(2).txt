                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage, treated with worsening respiratory
 insufficiency, to assess for volume overload or effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has
 taken a better inspiration.  The tip of the endotracheal tube measures
 approximately 2.7 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube remains within the
 fundus of the stomach.  Streak of atelectasis is seen at the right base. 
 There may be mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 Some respiratory motion partially obscures the image, making it difficult to
 unequivocally exclude a small area of consolidation.
