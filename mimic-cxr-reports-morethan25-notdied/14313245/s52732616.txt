 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post tracheostomy removal.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal
 atelectasis at the right lung bases.  Otherwise, the lung parenchyma is
 unremarkable.  Neither the frontal nor the lateral radiographs show evidence
 of pleural effusions.  The tracheostomy tube is removed and the right
 subclavian catheter is also removed.  Left-sided tubular structure in the neck
 and along the left apex is not appreciated on the lateral radiographs.
