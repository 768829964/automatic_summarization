                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST WITH DECUB
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with polytrauma; t-bone by ___-___; b/l
 pneumothoraces  // portable w/ lateral view; assess s/p replacement L pigtail
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright portable AP and cross-table lateral chest
 radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 13:13.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right chest tube appears unchanged in orientation.  The left pigtail has
 changed in orientation, however appears to be in the pleural space.  The ETT
 is in appropriate positioning.  There is right subclavian, which terminates in
 the distal SVC.  There is a NG tube in appropriate positioning.
 
 The left tension pneumothorax persists, and has not decreased in size
 significantly.  The right apex, which was not adequately visualized on the
 prior chest radiograph, reveals a residual 1.5 cm apical pneumothorax.  There
 is developing patchy opacification, which silhouettes the right heart border. 
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pleural effusion is seen.  Significant
 bilateral subcutaneous emphysema persists.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Right chest tube, left pigtail, NG tube, right subclavian, and NG tube all
 in appropriate positioning.
 2. Persistent left tension pneumothorax, which has not decreased in size. 
 Small right apical pneumothorax.
 3. Developing patchy opacification at right heart border concerning for
 developing pneumonia
