                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M unrestrained driver, T-boned in MVC, intubated at scene with
 IVH, L frontal contusion, R inferior orbital wall fx, small b/l PTX, LUL
 collapse, posterior liver lac, and non-displaced acute fx of L glenoid, L
 humeral mid shaft fracture.  Interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 3.7 cm above the carina.  Nasoenteric tube
 terminates in the stomach.  Right-sided PICC line tip is in the region of the
 lower SVC.  Multifocal consolidations in the mid and lower lungs, right
 greater than left, are unchanged.  Subcutaneous air within the left chest wall
 has increased.
 
 Of note, small bilateral apical pneumothoraces are now seen, new on the right
 an larger on the left, since the radiograph from the prior day.  Left chest
 tube is still present.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Compared with the prior study, there is a new small right apical
 pneumothorax and a larger, though small, left apical pneumothorax.  No
 evidence of mediastinal shift.
 
 2.  Multifocal consolidation in the mid and lower lungs, right greater than
 left, are unchanged.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The above findings were communicated via telephone by Dr.
 ___ to Dr. ___ at 10:46 on ___, ___ min after discovery.
