                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M unrestrained driver, T-boned in ___, intubated at scene with
 IVH, L frontal contusion, R inferior orbital wall fx, small b/l PTX, LUL
 collapse, posterior liver lac, and non-displaced acute fx of L glenoid, L
 humeral mid shaft fracture.  // Interval change of left pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph from 1 day earlier, bilateral small
 pneumothoraces are a persistent finding, with a left pigtail pleural catheter
 remaining in place.  Interval slight decrease in extent of pneumomediastinum. 
 Moderate layering right pleural effusion and small layering left pleural
