                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M unrestrained driver, T-boned in MVC, intubated at scene with
 IVH, L frontal contusion, R inferior orbital wall fx, small b/l PTX, LUL
 collapse, posterior liver lac, and non-displaced acute fx of L glenoid, L
 humeral mid shaft fracture.  // Placement of right chest tube - concern that
 it is in subcutaneous space.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right and left chest tubes appear to be within the pleural space, and
 unchanged in orientation in comparison to the prior chest radiograph.  The ETT
 is in appropriate positioning.  There is a right subclavian, which terminates
 in the distal SVC.  There is an NG tube in appropriate positioning.
 
 The right pneumothorax appears to have resolved.  There is an unchanged left
 pneumothorax with apical and subpulmonic components, with evidence of tension.
 Heart size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The
 pulmonary vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion is
 seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Unchanged appearance of right and left chest tubes within the pleural
 space.
 2.  Unchanged left pneumothorax with evidence of tension.
 3.  Appropriate positioning of ET tube, right subclavian, and NG tube.
