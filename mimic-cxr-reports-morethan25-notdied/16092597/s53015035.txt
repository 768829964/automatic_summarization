                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M unrestrained driver with bilateral PTx, now s/p right CT
 removal  // interval change of right pneumothorax, please obtain at ___
 (___)
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 11:  ___, small biapical pneumothoraces are again
 seen.  The right apical pneumothorax is probably very slightly larger.  The
 left chest tube remains in place.
 
 The patient is status post tracheostomy.  A right-sided central line and right
 subclavian PICC line are both present, with tips both over the distal SVC.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There are hazy relatively diffuse
 alveolar opacities in both lungs.  Below the appearance may be accentuated by
 technique, the appear slightly more pronounced and confluent on the current
 examination.  No gross effusion.  Upper zone redistribution noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Bilateral small apical pneumothoraces, slightly larger on the right.
 2. Slight increase in the prominence of the bilateral alveolar opacities.  The
 differential diagnosis is extensive and best correlated clinically.  The
 differential diagnosis includes early CHF, residua from contusions, pneumonic
 infiltrates or early ARDS.
