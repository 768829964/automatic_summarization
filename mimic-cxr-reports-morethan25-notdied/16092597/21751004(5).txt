                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M unrestrained driver, T-boned in MVC, intubated at scene with
 IVH, L frontal contusion, R inferior orbital wall fx, small b/l PTX, LUL
 collapse, posterior liver lac, and non-displaced acute fx of L glenoid, L
 humeral mid shaft fracture.  // AM CXR, chest tube to -___ suction   AM CXR,
 chest tube to -___ suction
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 05:26.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small left pneumothorax is probably unchanged since earlier in the day. 
 Heterogeneous consolidation in both lungs is probably unchanged, with some
 apparent redistribution due to increasing atelectasis, particularly in the
 right lower lobe.  Heart is normal size.  Pleural effusions minimal if any.
 
 ET tube and right subclavian line and nasogastric drainage tube are in
 standard placements respectively.
