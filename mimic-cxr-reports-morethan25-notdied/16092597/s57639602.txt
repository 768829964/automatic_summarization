                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with worsening hypoxia, vent requirements, bilat
 chest tubes  // eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The support devices are unchanged and in good position.  Given for differences
 in technique, small right apical pneumothorax is stable.  The left moderate
 pneumothorax appears larger, however this is likely due to the patient's more
 erect positioning.  Mild pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema are
 stable.  There is improved aeration of the lungs with persistent multifocal
 opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Considering technical differences and patient positioning, persistent
 bilateral pneumothoraces and pneumomediastinum are stable in appearance.
 
 Multifocal airspace opacities in the lower lobe have developed since trauma on
 ___, suggestive of aspiration pneumonia or infection.
