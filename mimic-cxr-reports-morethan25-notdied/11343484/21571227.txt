 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with intracerebral hemorrhage and right lower lobe
 infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Patient has persistent moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular
 engorgement.  The lower lungs are largely obscured by heavy asbestos-related
 pleural calcifications.  There could be atelectasis or consolidation in the
 right lower lobe, but the findings could actually be minimal.  If the
 determination of the presence of any consolidation is of high clinical
 importance, I would recommend CT scanning.
