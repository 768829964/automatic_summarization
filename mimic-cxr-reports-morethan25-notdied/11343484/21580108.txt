                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:17 AM, ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hypertension.  Brain hemorrhage.  Increased
 sputum after tracheostomy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Heavy pleural calcification due to asbestos exposure obscures large areas in
 the lower lungs, but symmetric increase in radiodensity in the lung bases is
 probably due to pulmonary edema.  But given the visual complexity, it would be
 necessary to perform chest CT scanning to detect a subtle pneumonia.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is longstanding.  Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.  Left
 subclavian line ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
