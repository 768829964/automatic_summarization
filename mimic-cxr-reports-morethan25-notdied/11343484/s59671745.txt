                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated with intraparenchymal hemorrhage complicated by
 meningitis, now with respiratory desaturation and tachypnea, here to evaluate
 for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___,
 most recently ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Dobbhoff feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with
 the elongated tip in the gastric fundus, which could be advanced further into
 the stomach.  A tracheostomy is in place.  A right PICC line is repositioned
 now with the tip terminating in the mid-to-low SVC.  Opacification of the
 bilateral bases greater on the left than the right is minimally increased from
 the most recent prior study compatible with small pleural effusions and
 atelectasis.  Diaphragmatic calcifications and pleural calcified plaques are
 again noted consistent with asbestos exposure.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 moderately enlarged.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  The
 pulmonary vasculature appears engorged but stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Persistent pulmonary vascular congestion, small pleural effusions and
 slightly increased bibasilar atelectasis on the left greater than the right.
 2.  Improved positioning of right PICC with tip terminating in the mid-to-low
 SVC.
