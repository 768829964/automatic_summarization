 HISTORY:  Tracheostomy and meningitis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little interval change. 
 Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with elevated pulmonary venous

 the right base laterally.  Patchy opacification in the right mid zone is
 unchanged.  Pleural plaquing is again seen bilaterally with calcification in
 the hemidiaphragmatic region.
