                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CVA, to assess for change.

 change.  Monitoring and support devices remain in place.  Continued mild
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary edema and areas of
 atelectasis at both bases with small effusions.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.  
 
 Extensive pleural calcifications along the hemidiaphragm and mediastinum are
