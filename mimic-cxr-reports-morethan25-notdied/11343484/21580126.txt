                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:04 A.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with a right basal ganglia hemorrhage, after
 tracheostomy tube, unable to tolerate CPAP.  Is there pulmonary edema or
 pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular engorgement have
 improved since ___.  Small left pleural effusion and moderate
 cardiomegaly persist.  Extent of bibasilar consolidation difficult to assess
 given the overlying heavy asbestos-related calcified pleural plaque. 
 Conceivably, a lateral conventional chest radiograph would be helpful in
 determining how much of the abnormality at the lung bases, particularly the
 right, is due to pleural effusion and how much due to lower lobe atelectasis
 or consolidation.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is turned, tip abutting the left wall.  Right PIC line ends
 in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
