                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with MSSA pneumonia.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position.  Left-sided PICC is in unchanged
 position and terminates in the upper SVC.  There is stable moderate
 cardiomegaly.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  There is
 stable mild pulmonary edema.  The lung volumes are low bilaterally.  There is
 an unchanged, moderate left pleural effusion.  Apparent interval increase in
 right basilar opacity may reflect an enlarging right pleural effusion with
 adjacent atelectasis or a more supine position of the patient.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Apparent interval increase in right basilar opacity may reflect an enlarging
 right pleural effusion with adjacent atelectasis or a more supine position of
 the patient.
