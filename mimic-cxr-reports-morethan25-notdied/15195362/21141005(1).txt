 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient is status post thyroid tumor resection and
 tracheostomy.  Assess Dobbhoff tube.
 
 Dobbhoff tube tip is in the stomach.  Tracheostomy is in the standard
 position.  Bibasilar opacities larger on the left side.  There are combination
 of mild-to-moderate effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  There is no evident
 pneumothorax.  Cardiac size is top normal.  When compared to prior study
 performed the same day earlier in the morning widened mediastinum has
 improved.  Apical atelectasis has improved.  Vascular congestion has almost
