                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with thyroid cancer.  Study requested for
 evaluation of trach and infiltrate/changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___
 and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tracheostomy tube appears in relatively horizontal orientation,
 unchanged from prior examination.  However, complete assessment is difficult
 in this single view.  A right PICC line terminates in the region of the right
 subclavian vein. Feeding tube projects below the contours of the diaphragm,
 the tip is not included in this examination. There is diffuse mediastinal
 widening, consistent with known thyroid mass, unchanged from prior
 examinations.  Cardiac silhouette is stable.  Widespread pulmonary metastases
 are again demonstrated. Right lower lung opacity is slightly increased, likely
 related to a combination of atelectasis and pleural fluid.  The left lung is
 clear.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slightly increased right lower lung opacity, likely related to a
 combination of atelectasis and pleural fluid.
 
 2.  Unchanged mediastinal contour, in keeping with history of large thyroid
 mass.
