                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Large mediastinal mass from known thyroid carcinoma with nasal
 intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 4 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to study from six hours prior, there has been interval
 improvement in interstitial edema.  Otherwise, there is no significant change
 with persistently low lung volumes, bilateral left greater than right
 effusions, bibasilar atelectasis with unchanged wide mediastinal contour from
 known thyroid carcinoma, and unchanged positioning of endotracheal tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement of interstitial edema, otherwise without
 significant change from exam six hours prior.
