                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates about 2.7 cm above the carina. 
 Trachea is markedly shifted through the left due to a large right superior
 mediastinal mass which arises from the thyroid gland as demonstrated on neck
 CT of ___.  Heart is enlarged and accompanied by mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  A new area of airspace opacity has developed in the
 right infrahilar region, and could reflect asymmetrical edema.  Differential
 diagnosis includes an acute aspiration event.  Bilateral small pleural
 effusions are also demonstrated.
