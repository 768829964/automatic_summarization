                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Ventilator dependent with known tracheal stenosis.  Evaluate for
 pneumothorax or infiltrate.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal semi supine chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: A tracheostomy tube terminates within the mid trachea.  A feeding
 tube courses along the esophagus and terminates out of the field of view,
 likely within the stomach.
 
 The lung volumes are low, which limits evaluation.  Opacities are seen at the
 right lung base with some appearing linear and others containing air
 bronchograms.  No pneumothorax or definite pleural effusion.  There is
 prominence of the central vasculature without evidence for pulmonary edema. 
 The cardiac contour is normal.  Prominence of the mediastinum may reflect the
 presence of an azygous fissure, especially in the absence of symptoms from
 pathologic widening.
 
 IMPRESSION: Opacities at the right lung base are at least in part due to
 atelectasis given the low lung volumes, however, pneumonia cannot be excluded.
 No baseline is available and comparison should be made to prior imaging. 
 Apparent prominence of the mediastinum could be evaluated for stabilty as well
 with comparisons.
