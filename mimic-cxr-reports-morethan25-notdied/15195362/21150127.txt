 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:27 PM
  Lung volumes are very low.  There is a large right pleural effusion with
  opacity in the right lower lung which may represent pneumonia or atelectasis. 
  Left lower lobe opacity may be atelectasis or pneumonia.  Nodular opacities
  compatible with known metastatic disease.  Tracheostomy tube in place.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  SVC syndrome and leukocytosis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are substantially lower
 lung volumes.  Large pleural effusion with underlying compressive atelectasis.
 Less prominent changes are seen on the left.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, the possibility of superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered.  Dilatation of the gas-filled stomach despite a Dobbhoff tube in
 place.  Tracheostomy tube remains in place.  
 
 What appears to be a right PICC line, it seems to extend barely into the right
 hemithorax.
 
 A nodular quality of some of the markings is compatible with known metastatic
 disease.
