                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with thyroid cancer, confirm
 tracheostomy position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study dated ___.  The long semi-metallic
 wide- caliber tracheostomy cannula is again identified.  Apparently its
 external portion has now been flipped over to the patient's left side.  The
 more central portion of the tube is overlying trachea on the frontal view
 still pointing somewhat to the left wall of the trachea, but not penetrating
 it.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax and no new pulmonary parenchymal
 abnormalities are identified.  A previously described Dobbhoff line remains in
 place, reaching into the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tracheostomy tube in place.  External portion of the tube has
 changed position.  Central portion of tube overlying trachea on frontal view. 
 Single view examination cannot render further detail.  If difficulties with
 tracheostomy position have been encountered, recommend fluoroscopic
 examination.
