                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube and feeding tube remain in place. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance with persistent marked
 widening of right superior mediastinal contour, corresponding to known large
 thyroid mass.  This has been more fully characterized by recent MRI exam. 
 Worsening right lower lobe opacity probably represents atelectasis, but
 coexisting infectious pneumonia is possible in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  Lungs are otherwise clear.
