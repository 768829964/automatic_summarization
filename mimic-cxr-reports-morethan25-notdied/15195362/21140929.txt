                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with large mediastinal
 mass, currently intubated.  Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed
 in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carina.  The heart size and mediastinum
 are unchanged including cardiomegaly.  Bilateral pleural effusions are
 moderate.  Vascular engorgement is mild.  Overall, no substantial interval
 change demonstrated.  The large thyroid gland contributes to the right upper
 mediastinal enlargement and better appreciated on the CT chest.  Pulmonary
 nodules seen on the chest CT are not seen on the current study but should be
 followed at least within three months interval for assessment of stability
 given the relatively large size.  Also, correlation with history of malignancy
 is present is required.
