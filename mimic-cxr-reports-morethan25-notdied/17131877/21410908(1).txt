                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST AT 4:43 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  This is an ___-year-old woman with aspiration pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 The patient is rotated severely rightward, obscuring much of the right lower
 lung which is under-inflated, and possibly consolidated, and probably
 unchanged over the past several days.  In the left lung, I see vascular
 congestion, but no consolidation.  There is no left pleural effusion, but the
 positioning obscures what could be even a moderate right pleural effusion, and
 it underestimates heart size.  There is no pneumothorax.
