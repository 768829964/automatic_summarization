                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  
 
 There is subsegmental atelectasis in the right lung base. Minimal atelectasis
 at the left base.  The lungs are otherwise grossly clear.  There is no chf,
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is not
 enlarged. 
 
 Tubing coursing vertically over the right chest is compatible with a VP shunt.
 Mask or other iatrogenic material overlies the right lung apex, obscuring to a
 small degree.
