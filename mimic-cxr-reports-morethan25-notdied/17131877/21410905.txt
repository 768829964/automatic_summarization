                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with intracranial aneurysm,
 assessment for interval change.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 05:21 a.m.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable.  There is slight interval improvement
 in opacification of the right lung with left basal opacity still persistent,
 finding that might potentially reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema. 
 Consolidation due to infection would be less likely.  No pneumothorax or
 pleural effusion is seen.
