                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Aneurysm coiling. 
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiomegaly, widened mediastinum and elongated aorta are unchanged.  Aeration
 of the left lower lobe has minimally improved.  Diffuse opacities in the right
 lung, worse in the lower lobe and medially in the upper lobe are unchanged,
 worrisome for aspiration. In the right base opacity is also due to a
 combination of atelectasis and effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
