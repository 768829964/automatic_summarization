                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation, hypercarbic RF, question interval imaging.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with the prior film, ET tube has been placed.  The tip lies
 approximately 2.6 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip extending
 beneath the diaphragm overlying the fundus.  Rounded density overlying the
 upper abdomen to the left of midline is not fully characterized, ? balloon
 related to g-tube or structure outside of the patient. 
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent, but unchanged.  There is upper zone
 re-distribution, without overt CHF.  There are patchy bibasilar opacities. 
 Minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval intubation.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval
 change.
