                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with intubation  // proper ETT position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube ends 5 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube ends in
 the intrathoracic stomach. The right lung is clear. Opacity in the left
 retrocardiac space and obscuring the left heart border may be due to the large
 hiatal hernia however aspiration and infection cannot be excluded. There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac size is likely normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube ends 5 cm above the carina.  Orogastric tube terminates
 within the lower chest likely within a large hiatal hernia. Retrocardiac
 opacity raises potential concern for aspiration versus pneumonia.
