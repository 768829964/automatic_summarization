                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with status epilepticus (nonconvulsive)  //
 interval change      interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 05:58
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP supine chest from ___ 05:55 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart remains enlarged which may reflect pericardial effusion or cardiomegaly.
 Clinical correlation is advised. The endotracheal tube has its tip
 approximately 2.3 cm above the carina. A nasogastric tube is seen coursing
 below the diaphragm with the tip not identified. The right subclavian PICC
 line is unchanged in position with its tip in the distal SVC near the
 cavoatrial junction. Mild perihilar edema is present. There are layering
 effusions with bibasilar patchy opacities, left greater than right, most
 likely reflecting compressive lower lobe atelectasis, although superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded. No pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to
 detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
