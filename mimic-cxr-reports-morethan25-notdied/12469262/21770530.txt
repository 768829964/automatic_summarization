                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Liver disease with pneumonia, intubated.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube ends 4.7 cm above the level of the carina.  A
 right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the low SVC.  A
 large-bore tunneled right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the
 high right atrium, unchanged.  A Dobbhoff tube ends within the stomach.  Lung
 volumes are low, decreased compared to the prior study.  Heterogeneous
 opacities at the left lung base are increased, likely secondary to pneumonia,
 although atelectasis could have a similar appearance.  The right lung is
 clear, allowing for bronchovascular crowding.  The heart size is normal.  The
 mediastinal contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Increased left lower lung heterogeneous opacities, concerning for
 infectiom.
 
 2.  Appropriately positioned lines and tubes.
