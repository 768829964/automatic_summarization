                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluation for interval change in a patient with respiratory
 failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-erect view of the chest was reviewed and compared
 to the prior studies.  An endotracheal tube ends 6 cm above the carina.  A
 Dobbhoff tube ends in the stomach.  A right internal jugular line ends in the
 upper to mid superior vena cava and a large bore tunneled right internal
 jugular central venous catheter ends in the low superior vena cava.  Lung
 volumes have improved and left lower lung parenchymal opacities have
 decreased.  The right lung is clear.  Normal heart, pleural and mediastinal
 surfaces.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube tip ends 6 cm above the carina.  
 
 2.  Improved lung volumes and decreased left lower lung parenchymal opacity.
