                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Feeding tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent radiograph from earlier today, a feeding tube has been placed
 with tip terminating in the proximal stomach.  Pre-existing nasogastric tube
 extends to the region of the gastroduodenal junction.  The chest is
 incompletely imaged on this radiograph targeted for feeding tube assessment
 but the thorax has been more fully assessed by a a recent chest radiograph
 from several hr earlier.
