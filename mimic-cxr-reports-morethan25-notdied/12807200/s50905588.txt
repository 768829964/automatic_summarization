 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p fall, found down unknown duration, found to have small
 foci IPH, nondisplaced sternal manubrial ___, mediastinal hematoma, L4 burst
 fracture with retropulsion and obliteration of the spinal canal, T11/L2
 compression fracture, T10 left superior facet, T11 inf facet fracture, R fem
 neck ___, R proximal femur ___, ___ R PTX s/p bronchoscopy  // interval change 
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support devices are
 essentially unchanged.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications are again
 consistent with the multifocal pneumonia described on CT.
 Indistinctness of the left hemidiaphragm is consistent with pleural fluid and
 volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Mild effusion may also be present on the
 right.
 Of incidental note are spinal fusion devices in the lumbar region.
