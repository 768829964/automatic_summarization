                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Upright chest portable radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p fall, found down unknown duration, found to have small
 foci IPH, nondisplaced sternal manubrial ___, mediastinal hematoma, L4 burst
 fracture with retropulsion and obliteration of the spinal canal, T11/L2
 compression fracture, T10 left superior facet, T11 inf facet fracture, R fem
 neck ___, R proximal femur ___, ___ R PTX s/p reintubation with acute
 desaturation requiring recruitment maneuvers in setting of abundant oral
 secretions // mucous plugging
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest upright portable radiographs
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 05:34
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to exam approximately 10 hours prior, there is improvement of the
 right perihilar opacity. However, the right lower lobe opacity remains,
 concerning for aspiration or pneumonia.  Lingular atelectasis is stable.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is no pulmonary edema,
 pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.  Monitoring and support lines are unchanged
 and appropriate in positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent right lower lobe opacity, concerning for aspiration or pneumonia.
