                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p fall, found down unknown duration, found to have small
 foci IPH, nondisplaced sternal manubrial ___, mediastinal hematoma, L4 burst
 fracture with retropulsion and obliteration of the spinal canal, T11/L2
 compression fracture, T10 left superior facet, T11 inf facet fracture, R fem
 neck ___, R proximal femur ___, ___ R PTX s/p extubation, diuresis, continued
 treatment for PNA  // interval change  interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the nasogastric tube is been removed.
 The Dobhoff tube just straddles the esophagogastric junction and should be
 pushed forward about 8-10 cm for more optimal positioning.
 There is increasing opacification at the right base.  This is consistent with
 worsening pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis.  Less prominent
 basilar opacification is noted on the left.
 The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged and there may be some mild elevation
 of pulmonary venous pressure.
 A more coalescent area of opacification is again seen in the right mid zone. 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, this could reflect superimposed
 pneumonia.
