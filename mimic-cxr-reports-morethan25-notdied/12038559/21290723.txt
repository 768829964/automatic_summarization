                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MR, difficulty weaning vent.  // assess
 pulmonary edema      assess pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to severe pulmonary edema has improved since ___, although
 mild cardiomegaly and small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  There is
 a good possibility, given the heterogeneity of edema, that there is concurrent
 pneumonia, particularly at the lung bases and in the right upper lobe.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement, but sharp definition of the cuff reflects
 secretions pooling above it.  Right subclavian line ends in the upper SVC and
 a nasogastric tube passes to the distal stomach and out of view.
