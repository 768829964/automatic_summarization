                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p AVR/MVR  // eval postop changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ radiograph, postoperative appearance of
 cardiomediastinal contours stable.  Bibasilar atelectasis has decreased in
 severity, and small bilateral pleural effusions have also apparently decreased
 in size in the interval.  Retrosternal streaks of gas on the lateral view are
 likely related to recent sternotomy procedure.  Small curvilinear lucency
 adjacent to right hemidiaphragm is not fully evaluated.  If there is clinical
 suspicion for free intraperitoneal air, left lateral decubitus abdominal
 radiograph would be recommended for initial further assessment.
