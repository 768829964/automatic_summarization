                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man status post pericardial window with left
 ventricular puncture.  Evaluate for postprocedural complications.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest radiograph ___.  Outside
 hospital CT torso ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A catheter is seen overlying the cardiac apex.  The cardiac silhouette is
 enlarged, increased since ___.  A dense left retrocardiac opacity may
 represent a combination of atelectasis and a pericardial effusion. Opacity in
 the right lower lobe is unchanged since at least ___ and most consistent
 with atelectasis and overlying soft tissues.  A small left pleural effusion is
 new since ___.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Enlarged cardiac silhouette, slightly increased since ___, compatible
 with a pericardial effusion.  Although a catheter is seen overlying the
 cardiac apex, correlation with catheter output and consideration of an
 echocardiogram are recommended.
 2. New small left pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___
