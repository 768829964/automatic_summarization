 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumonia  // ?improvement of lef lung
 shadow      ?improvement of lef lung shadow
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Global interstitial pulmonary abnormality has worsened, now with consolidation
 in the right lung.  Rapid progression is more typical of pulmonary edema than
 pneumonia alone though pneumonia could be present as well. Findings are most
 consistent with edema due to cardiac decompensation, particularly with
 worsening dilatation of mediastinal veins, and/or increased intracranial
 pressure. Small to moderate right pleural effusion is larger.  No
 pneumothorax.
