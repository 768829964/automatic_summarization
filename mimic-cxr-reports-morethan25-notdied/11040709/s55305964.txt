                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation at outside hospital, evaluate for tube
 placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph and supine and semi upright
 position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Initial radiograph shows the endotracheal tube terminating 6.5 cm from the
 carina. The tube was subsequently repositioned and the followup image shows
 the endotracheal tube terminating 4.3 cm above the carina in appropriate
 position. There are bilateral perihilar opacities with a "bat-wing" 
 appearance which likely reflects neurogenic edema versus severe aspiration.
 The cardiac silhouette is normal. There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube terminating 4.3 cm above the carina in appropriate
 position.
 
 2.  Moderate neurogenic edema and/or severe aspiration.
