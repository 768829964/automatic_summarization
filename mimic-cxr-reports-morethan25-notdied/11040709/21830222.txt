                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SOB, diaphoresis, hypotension.  // Does pt
 have a pneumothorax?      Does pt have a pneumothorax?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 16:23
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright chest film ___ at 23:15 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position. A left chest tube remains
 in place. A tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position. There are
 layering bilateral effusions with patchy airspace disease, left greater than
 right, likely reflecting atelectasis. No pulmonary edema. No pneumothorax is
 appreciated, but this could be related to differences in patient positioning
 between studies as the pneumothorax on the prior study is small.
