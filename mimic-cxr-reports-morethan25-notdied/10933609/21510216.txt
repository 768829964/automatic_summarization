                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  NG tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the Dobbhoff tube now
 extends to the distal stomach.  The tube takes an unusual course, raising the
 possibility of previous gastric surgery.
 
 When compared to the study of ___, the extensive bilateral opacification has
 substantially decreased.  Some of the residual may merely reflect fibrotic
 healing.
