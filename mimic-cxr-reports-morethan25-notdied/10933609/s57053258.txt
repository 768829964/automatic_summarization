                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Check Dobbhoff tube position, worsening cough and sweats and
 elevated white count.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 By ___, the patient has largely cleared the extensive consolidation
 affecting all of the left lung and the right upper lung at the beginning of
 ___.  Residual peribronchial opacification in the upper lungs was
 probably scarring, and persists.  There may be a very slight increase in the
 pleural perfusion of abnormality in the left upper lung, but not enough to
 call pneumonia, and the lower lungs are essentially clear.  Heart size is
 normal.  Mediastinal and hilar silhouettes are unremarkable and no pleural
 abnormality.  Feeding tube follows the same course through either a medially
 displaced stomach or postoperative gastric remnant.  No pleural abnormality.
