                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and a prior CT from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lethargy, shortness of breath, question pneumonia. 
 Previously noted PICC line has been removed.  There is stable appearance of
 the linear interstitial markings within the upper lungs which likely reflect
 chronic scarring given the chronicity over time.  No definite evidence of
 pneumonia or CHF.  Stable left CP angle blunting noted.  Overall,
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears unchanged.  No acute bony abnormality is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable exam with no acute intrathoracic process.  Unchanged
 linear densities in the upper lungs likely reflective of scarring.
