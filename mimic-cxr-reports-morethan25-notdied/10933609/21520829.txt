                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rib fracture, hypoxemia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart size is normal.  Lung volumes are low.  Biapical fibrotic changes
 with traction bronchiectasis is re- demonstrated.  Minimal blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle suggests a trace left pleural effusion.  Streaky
 bibasilar airspace opacities likely reflect atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  Known fracture of the left 11th rib is not clearly delineated on
 this exam.  Clips are seen projecting over the left upper quadrant.  No new
 fractures are seen.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures but
 no overt pulmonary edema is demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Chronic fibrotic changes within both lung apices.  Low lung volumes with
 probable bibasilar atelectasis, though infection or aspiration cannot be
 excluded.  Small left pleural effusion.  Known left 11th rib fracture is not
 clearly seen on the current exam.
