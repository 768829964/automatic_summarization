 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of pneumonia, evaluation for effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 slightly increased.  The pre-existing, predominantly perihilar opacities have
 substantially decreased in extent and severity.  The remaining opacities are
 now predominating in the upper lobes and are located around the upper aspects
 of the left and right hilus.
 
 No newly appeared opacities.  The left internal jugular vein catheter has been
 removed, the lateral radiograph shows evidence of a small left effusion,
 obliterating the dorsal aspects of the costophrenic sinus.
