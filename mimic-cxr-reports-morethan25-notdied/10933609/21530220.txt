                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aspiration, now productive cough and increased white count with some
 worsening consolidation.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___.
 
 There is a dominant area of patchy opacity in the right upper zone.  This is
 slightly more pronounced than on the prior film, though much of this may be
 accounted for by differences in film technique.  There is minimal increased
 interstitial marking in the left suprahilar and right infrahilar regions,
 which is similar to the prior film.  No new area of opacity or confluent
 consolidation is identified.  No effusion.  Again seen are low inspiratory
 volumes.  The lateral view, however, suggests anterior hyperinflation. 
 Incidental note made of a surgical anchor over the right glenoid.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Equivocal slight worsening of the opacity in the right upper zone. 
 Otherwise, no interval change identified.  
 
 2) Compared to a radiograph from ___, the opacity in the right upper zone
 has improved, as have changes at the right cardiophrenic region.
