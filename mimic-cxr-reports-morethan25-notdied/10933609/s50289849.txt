                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of altered mental status,
 concern for infectious etiology.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  There is
 interval increase in bilateral upper lobe opacities, right greater than left. 
 Evidence of scarring is again seen with retraction of the hila bilaterally. 
 No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Evidence of a left-sided
 rib fracture is again seen, although not well evaluated.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in bilateral upper lobe, right greater than
 left opacities raises concern for infectious process superimposed on chronic
 changes.
