                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dizziness, nausea, vomiting.  Evaluate for cardiopulmonary
 disease or infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Lung volumes are
 low, similar to the prior study.  The previously noted dense consolidation of
 the right upper lobe has improved with diffuse streaky opacities remaining. 
 There are findings consistent with chronic lung disease such as sarcoidosis. 
 Prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings is due to mild heart
 failure. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is notable for a tortuous aorta.  Bones are slightly osteopenic.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Improving right upper lobe consolidation.
 2. Mild heart failure.
 3. Findings of chronic lung disease, most likely sarcoidosis.
