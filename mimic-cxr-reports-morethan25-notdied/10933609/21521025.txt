                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Weakness.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are reduced.  The left internal jugular central venous catheter
 has been removed.  The heart size is borderline enlarged, but accentuated due
 to low inspiratory lung volumes.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures with probable mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Worsening
 consolidative opacity in the right upper lung field as well as focal opacities
 within the left upper and bilateral lower lung fields are concerning for
 multifocal pneumonia.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  No acute
 osseous abnormalities visualized.  Clips are demonstrated within the left
 upper quadrant of the abdomen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Worsening multifocal opacities concerning for pneumonia.  Probable mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Low lung volumes.
