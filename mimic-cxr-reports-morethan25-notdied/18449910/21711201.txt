                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:19 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Patient on a ventilator following aortic endograft repair.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Postoperative caliber of the mediastinum, with particular widening superior to
 the aortic endograft, has been stable for more than a week.  Mild asymmetric
 edema persists, favoring the left lung.  Left lower lobe atelectasis and small
 left pleural effusion is stable.  Right lung shows relatively little
 atelectasis, and is otherwise clear.  Tracheostomy tube is off midline in the
 trachea and should be evaluated to confirm appropriate positioning.  No
 pneumothorax.
