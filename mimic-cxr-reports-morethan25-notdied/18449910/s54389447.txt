  Widened mediastinum compatible with known aortic dissection.  Hazy
  opacification of the left lung field may represent combination of layering
  pleural effusion and associated atelectasis on this single semi-erect view.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increasing shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is substantial widening of the
 mediastinum consistent with known aortic dissection.  Hazy opacification of
 the left hemithorax suggests layering pleural effusion with some degree of
 underlying atelectasis.  Right lung as visualized is essentially clear.
