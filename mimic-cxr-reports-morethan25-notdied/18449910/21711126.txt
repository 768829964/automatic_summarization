                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post emergent TEVAR with left mini thoracotomy washout for
 ruptured type B dissection status post left VATS washout and decortication,
 here for pre-operative evaluation of the chest prior to tracheostomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place with the tip 4 cm above the
 carina.  An enteric feeding tube has been removed from the most recent prior
 study.  The patient is status post TEVAR with a large endograft involving the
 distal aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta to the level of the
 diaphragm.  The mediastinal contours are widened but stable over multiple
 prior studies.  Small bilateral pleural effusions greater on the left than the
 right are noted.  Opacification of the left lung base is slightly increased
 from ___, likely reflecting worsening atelectasis.  No new
 consolidation concerning for pneumonia is detected.  There is no overt
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Stable post-operative appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions on the left greater than the right with
 increased opacification of the left lung base most likely reflecting increased
 pleural fluid and atelectasis.
 3.  No overt pulmonary edema.
