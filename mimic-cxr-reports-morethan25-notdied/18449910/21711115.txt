                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post thoracic endovascular aortic repair.  Dobbhoff
 tube placed, check position.
 
 CHEST:   The exact position of the tip of the Dobbhoff tube cannot be
 determined, but I doubt that it has progressed either through the antrum or
 the pylorus.
