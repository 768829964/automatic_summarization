                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, desaturation, evaluation for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient has an aortic stent graft.  The tracheostomy tube is
 visible in almost unchanged manner.  Cardiomegaly persists but the
 pre-existing atelectasis at the left lung base has increased in severity. 
 Also, there is a progressive blunting of the left costophrenic sinus,
 suggesting the presence of a small to moderate left pleural effusion.  Mild
 fluid overload.  No overt pulmonary edema.
