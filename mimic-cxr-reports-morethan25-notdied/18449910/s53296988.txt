                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post trach, decannulation with
 increased oxygen requirements, question infectious process.  Evaluate for
 acute changes.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at ___.
 
 An AP upright portable chest film with the patient seated in chair dated
 ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The patient's mandible obscures the apex and upper trachea limiting evaluation
 of this area.  An aortic stent graft remains in place.  No tracheostomy tube
 can be visualized.  Lung volumes are low with patchy streaky opacities at both
 bases likely reflecting atelectasis. No evidence of pulmonary edema, although
 there is crowding of the vasculature likely related to low volumes.  There is
 likely a small left effusion.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.
