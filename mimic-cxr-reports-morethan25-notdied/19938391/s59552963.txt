                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are continued areas of
 opacification at the right base and in the retrocardiac region.  Although this
 could represent atelectasis and effusion, the possibility of supervening
 pneumonia, especially at the right base, should be seriously considered in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
