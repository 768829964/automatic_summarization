                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Trachea and dependent with worsening shortness of breath.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The exam is essentially nondiagnostic due to underpenetration from presumed
 patient body habitus.  Grossly, the cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 stable as compared to ___.  Midline tracheotomy is again seen.  The right
 lung is less area as compared to the left which may be due to underlying
 atelectasis.  Patchy right mid to lower lung opacities are seen which could
 relate to atelectasis or infection or aspiration.  The costophrenic angles are
 not well seen and pleural effusions cannot be excluded.  The cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged.  The mediastinal contour pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Severely suboptimal study due to underpenetration from patient body habitus. 
 Stable cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Right mid to lower lung opacity may in
 part relate to underpenetration but underlying infection, aspiration,
 atelectasis, or other causes of consolidation not excluded.
