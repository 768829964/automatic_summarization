                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a nasogastric tube is
 visible.  The course of the upper and mid third of the tube can be followed
 but the tip is not displayed on the current chest radiograph.  An abdomen film
 from the ___, however, shows that the endotracheal tube projects
 with its tip over the proximal parts of the stomach.
