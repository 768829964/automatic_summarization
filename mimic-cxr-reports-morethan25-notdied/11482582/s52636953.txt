                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Left lower extremity edema.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable, two views.  
 
 FINDINGS:  Each view is relatively blurry with considerable overlying soft
 tissue attenution.  However, the cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours do
 not appear significantly changed.  The central pulmonary vascularity appears
 mildly prominent, suggestive of vascular congestion.  No definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Again, there is a smooth focus of pleural
 thickening along the lateral left lung apex, which appears not significantly
 changed since an earlier study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mildly prominent pulmonary vascular suggestive of congestion or
 fluid overload on limited views.
