                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with recent hypoxemic episode and reported emesis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates tracheostomy tube unchanged in
 position.  Patient's body habitus limits evaluation.  Within this limitation,
 right lower lobe opacity is new since prior exam.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart is moderately enlarged.  Left costophrenic
 angle is slightly obscured, suggestive of possible pleural effusion.  No
 appreciable pneumothorax.  No right pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Slightly limited evaluation due to patient's body habitus.  Right lower lobe
 opacity is new since prior exam, and may represent atelectasis or aspiration
 in appropriate clinical setting.
