                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory decompensation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are again low lung
 volumes with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without definite vascular
 congestion.  Again there is suggestion of some increased opacification at the
 right base medially, though this could merely reflect some crowding of vessels
 in this area.
 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in place.
