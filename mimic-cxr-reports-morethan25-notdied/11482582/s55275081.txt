                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New tracheostomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the new tracheostomy tube
 appears to be in good position without evidence of pneumothorax or
 pneumomediastinum.  Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent
 with elevated pulmonary venous pressure in this patient with some enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette.  The left hemidiaphragm is poorly seen, consistent
 with volume loss in the lower lobe and possible small pleural effusion.
