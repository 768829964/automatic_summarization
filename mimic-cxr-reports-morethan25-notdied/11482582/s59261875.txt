                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 15:13
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hemoptysis, worsening shortness of
 breath, and tachypnea.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 08:59.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 15:15 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right-sided central venous line is unchanged in position.  Given the
 positioning on this study, the tracheostomy tube appears to take a straight
 course with the tip projecting over the trachea but it is difficult to assess
 for adequate positioning given the projection of this image.  Heart remains
 enlarged. Mediastinal contours are stably widened.  There is worsening
 bilateral perihilar and airspace process, most likely representing pulmonary
 edema, although diffuse pneumonia or ARDS cannot be excluded.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  No large pneumothorax is appreciated, although the
 sensitivity to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
