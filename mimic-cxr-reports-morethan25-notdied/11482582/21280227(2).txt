                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 859
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with persistent desaturation, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 902 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Evaluation of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is markedly limited due
 to the patient rotation on the current examination.  A tracheostomy tube
 remains in place.  There is a right subclavian central line which likely has
 its tip in the distal SVC near the cavoatrial junction.  Lung volumes are low
 and there appears to be a diffuse bilateral airspace process, likely
 reflecting pulmonary edema, although a diffuse infectious process cannot be
 entirely excluded.  Followup imaging should be performed based on the clinical
 assessment.  No pneumothorax.
