                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Line placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis performed earlier the same day, chest
 radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip is in the low SVC.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  In particular, the previously noted right apical
 pneumothorax is not clearly visualized on the current exam.  There is
 persistent pneumomediastinum.  Heart size is mildly enlarged, and the
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Pneumatocele within the right
 lung base is similar compared to the previous exam.  Streaky opacities in the
 lung bases may reflect atelectasis.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 noted.  An enteric tube is noted which courses through the stomach, off the
 inferior borders of the film.  Skin ___ are seen overlying the midline
 upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the low SVC.  Enteric
 tube courses through the stomach.  
 
 2. Previously noted right pneumothorax is not clearly visualized on the
 current exam.  Persistent pneumomediastinum.
 
 3. Right basilar pneumatocele again demonstrated.  Patchy bibasilar opacities,
 possibly atelectasis, with small bilateral pleural effusions.
