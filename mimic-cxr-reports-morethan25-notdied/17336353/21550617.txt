                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  To look for consolidation and effusions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable upright chest view was read in comparison with
 multiple prior chest radiographs, with the most recent from ___ and
 six hours apart.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tip of left subclavian line ends at mid SVC. Left chest tube
 have been removed. Mild-to-moderate sized left-sided pneumothorax  is
 essentially new since prior radiograph.  Both lung volumes persistently remain
 low.  Top normal heart size is similar.  Lower lung opacity due to a
 combination of minimal atelectasis and presumed small pleural effusion is
 stable.  No new lung opacities of concern.  Subcutaneous emphysema along left
 lateral thoracic wall extending up to the axilla and supraclavicular regions
 is persisting, unchanged in extent and distribution.  Subclavian line tip lies
 at mid SVC. No other significant interval changes in the chest since prior
 radiograph acquired six hours apart.  
 
 IMPRESSION
 
 New mild to moderate left pneumothorax.
 
 Unchange left lung base opacity from small effusion and atelectasis
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the findings to Dr. ___ by phone
 on ___ at 12:03 p.m.
