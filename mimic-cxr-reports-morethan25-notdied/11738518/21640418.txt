                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with central line placed for hypotension
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph obtained same day ___ approximately 4
 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Supine portable chest radiograph through the chest demonstrates interval
 repositioning of the endotracheal tube which now appears 4 cm above the level
 of the carina, in appropriate position in this patient whose chin appears
 down.  An enteric tube descends the thorax along the expected course of the
 esophagus, termination in the stomach in unchanged position when compared to
 prior radiograph.  There has been interval placement of a right sided central
 line whose tip appears to terminate at the level of the cavoatrial junction. 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The heart appears stably enlarged.  The
 left hemithorax appears better aerated.  There is no large pleural effusion. 
 No focal opacity is identified concerning for pneumonia.  Persistent mild
 vascular congestion is present without overt edema.  A partially visualized
 aortic graft is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Improved position of the endotracheal tube, now 4 cm above the level of
 the carina.
 2.  Interval placement of right sided central line, its tip terminating at the
 level of the cavoatrial junction. No pneumothorax is identified on this supine
 portable radiograph.
 3.  Unchanged enteric tube with sideport close to the gastroesophageal
 junction.  Recommend advancing 2 to 3 cm for better placement within the
 gastric lumen.
