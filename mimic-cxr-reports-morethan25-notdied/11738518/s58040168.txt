                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is similar cardiomegaly.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged.  The chest appears hyperinflated.  Probably trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.  There is a possible developing opacity at the
 right lung base, probably in the right lower lobe, although not well seen on
 the lateral view.  Very vague asymmetric opacity is also newly apparently
 projecting over the left lateral upper lung.  A aortic stent graft is partly
 visible.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Concern for possible developing opacities which may indicate
 pneumonia.  Correlation with physical findings and other clinical factors is
 suggested.  Short-term follow-up radiographs may be helpful.
