 identified. The left subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position with its
 tip in the proximal SVC.
 
 There is persistent total opacification at the left lung base with an
 associated effusion most likely reflecting partial lower lobe atelectasis,
 although pneumonia cannot be excluded. In addition, there is interval
 appearance of mild to moderate pulmonary and interstitial edema.  There has
 also been interval appearance of a right lateral chest wall and neck
 subcutaneous emphysema.  Subcutaneous emphysema is also seen in the left neck
 soft tissues as well as a inferiorly in the left lateral abdominal wall. 
 Clinical correlation is advised as the  subcutaneous emphysema is a new
 finding.  There is no obvious pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  A catheter

 aortic stent are again seen.  The heart remains enlarged.
