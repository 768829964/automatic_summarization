                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with CP and RUQ pain  // evidence of fluid overload
 or pneumo, RUQ infection/cholecystits
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable with the cardiac silhouette
 quite enlarged. Other may be mild vascular congestion. No overt pulmonary
 edema is seen. No focal consolidation. Slight blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle is felt to more likely due to atelectasis and a trace
 pleural effusion. Partially imaged aortic stent graft noted but not well
 evaluated on this study.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Possible mild vascular
 congestion without overt pulmonary edema.
