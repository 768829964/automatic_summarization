                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD exacerbation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette persists with some apparent improvement
 in pulmonary vascularity, but some of this may merely reflect the upright PA
 rather than the supine AP portable technique.  No evidence of acute focal
 pneumonia.  Hyperexpansion of the lungs persists.
