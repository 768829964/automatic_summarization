                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Recent stroke, tracheostomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient was extubated
 and has received a tracheostomy.  The position of the tracheostomy tube is
 unremarkable.  Slightly increased retrocardiac atelectasis.  Otherwise, the
 bilateral areas of basal atelectasis are unchanged.  No other pathologic
 findings.  The presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
 No evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.
