                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube remains
 in place.  Nasogastric tube extends at least to the upper stomach, where it
 crosses the lower margin of the image.
 
 No change in the appearance of the cardiac silhouette.  The left hemidiaphragm
 has been obscured, consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe and
 possible pleural effusion.  Bibasilar atelectatic changes are seen.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of aspiration or pneumonia would
 have to be considered.
 
 Paucity of vessels with hyperlucency in the upper zones is again consistent
 with emphysema.
