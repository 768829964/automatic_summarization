                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Previously
 present interstitial edema has nearly resolved, and there has also been
 improved aeration in the left retrocardiac region with residual opacity
 remaining as well as a small left pleural effusion.  Upper lobe predominant
 emphysema is also demonstrated.
