 The band-like confluence of opacity at the right lung base is best explained
 by atelectasis, where as the more diffuse and indistinctly marginated
 opacification at the left is probably pneumonia.  Upper lungs are grossly
 clear and there is no pulmonary edema.  Heart is borderline enlarged.  Pleural
 effusion is small if any.  No pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy tube midline.
