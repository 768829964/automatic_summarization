                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  ___ RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Concern for chemical pneumonitis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-erect AP view.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient remains intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates about 2 cm
 above the carina. There is a left subclavian stent projecting over the left
 upper chest that appears unchanged. The venous stent appears compressed
 centrally which may be due to mass effect from adjacent bony structures. The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable reflecting a combination
 of lymphadenopathy and proliferation of mediastinal fat. There is similar
 perihilar atelectasis on the left and bilateral heterogeneous opacification.
 Left lower lobe consolidation is not very well assessed on portable AP
 radiography but left retrocardiac opacification appears similar to perhaps
 slightly increased.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar heterogeneous opacification of each lung; no clearly new area of
 opacification.
