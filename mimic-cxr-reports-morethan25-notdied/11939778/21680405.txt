                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Stable appearance of cardiomediastinal contours.  Bilateral
 alveolar opacities have slightly improved in the interval.  No definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Note that widened mediastinum could be due
 to distended vascular structures and/or prominent mediastinal fat, but an
 infiltrative mediastinal mass cannot be excluded.  After the patient has been
 extubated, standard PA and lateral chest radiographs within the department may
 be helpful for initial further evaluation of this finding.
