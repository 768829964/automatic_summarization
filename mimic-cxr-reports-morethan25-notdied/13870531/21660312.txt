                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right PICC with tip still in the right atrium on prior radiograph,
 now status post repositioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from approximately 7 hours prior, as well as on
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates the repositioned right PICC
 with the tip at the origin of the SVC.  Per discussion with the IV nurse, the
 PICC was pulled back only 4 cm, but radiographically it appears to have been
 withdrawn 7-8 cm.  The remainder of the exam is unchanged, demonstrating
 severe bilateral homogeneous opacities consistent with pulmonary edema.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Repositioned right PICC with the tip at the origin of the SVC.
