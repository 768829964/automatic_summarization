                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, the
 most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a right PICC with the
 tip in the right atrium.  For positioning in the low SVC, the PICC can be
 pulled back 5 cm.  The tip of the endotracheal tube is approximately 3.5 cm
 above the carina, and given that the patient's chin is in a downward position,
 should be pulled back 1.5 cm.  The remainder of the exam is unchanged,
 demonstrating severe pulmonary edema.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Right PICC with the tip in the right atrium.  To place the tip in the low
 SVC, the catheter can be pulled back 5 cm.  
 
 2. The tip of the endotracheal tube is approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. 
 Given that the patient's chin is in a downward position, the tube should be
 pulled back 1.5 cm.  
 
 3.  Unchanged bilateral homogeneous opacities which are more typical of
 predominant severe pulmonary edema rather than pneumonia alone. 
 
 These findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr.
 ___ at ___ on ___.
