                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Radiograph centered at thoracoabdominal junction was obtained for
 assessing an orogastric tube which terminates within the distal stomach.  The
 imaged portion of the chest appears similar to the prior study when allowances
 are made for technical differences between the exams.
