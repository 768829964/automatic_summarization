                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single frontal view of the chest.  Endotracheal tube terminates 3.4 cm above
 the carina.  Right PICC terminates in the lower SVC.  Single metallic clip
 along the left heart border is unchanged.  Widespread bilateral parenchymal
 opacities are similar to the prior exam, possibly representing multifocal
 infection or ARDS.  Heart size and cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Widespread bilateral parenchymal opacities are similar to prior and consistent
 with either multifocal infection or ARDS.
