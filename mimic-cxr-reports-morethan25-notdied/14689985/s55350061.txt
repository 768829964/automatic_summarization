                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:07 P.M., ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with thoracic spinal infarction after tracheostomy
 and gastrostomy, recurrent pneumonia.  Hypercarbia after bronchoscopy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Compared to ___ when there was extensive consolidation in the left lung,
 the current appearance of the left lung could be due to scarring or a slowly
 resolving residual of infection, but it is more clear today and has grown
 progressively so since the end of ___.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 may be present, but pulmonary vasculature is not sufficient to raise concern
 for heart failure, and the heart is normal size.  Transvenous pacer lead
 passes to the apex of right ventricle.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard
 position.  
 
 If despite the slow improvement in appearance of the left lung patient has
 symptoms of recurrent aspiration, the possibility of tracheoesophageal fistula
 should be investigated.
