                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent pneumonia, trach, with increased cough.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is rotated to the left.  Single lead right-sided pacemaker is
 again seen with lead extending to the expected location of the right
 ventricle, unchanged.  Midline tracheostomy tube is seen.  There is a small to
 moderate left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Left base
 retrocardiac opacity most likely represent combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis although underlying consolidation is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  The right costophrenic angle is not fully
 included on the frontal view although there may be a trace right pleural
 effusion.  Right base linear atelectasis/scarring is seen.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  No pneumothorax is seen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Small to moderate left pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis.  Left base
 retrocardiac opacity may represent combination of pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, underlying consolidation is not excluded in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
