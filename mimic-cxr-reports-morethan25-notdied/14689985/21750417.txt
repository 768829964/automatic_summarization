                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable AP view was compared with prior radiograph
 from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single pacemaker lead from right pectoral pacemaker device ends at the
 expected location of the right ventricle.  Right lung base opacity and
 mild-to-moderate right pleural effusion have worsened since ___.
 Given the clinical history, this may likely represent pneumonia/atelectasis. 
 Left lower lung atelectasis and presumed small left pleural effusion have
 decreased since ___.  Upper lungs are clear.  Heart size,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
