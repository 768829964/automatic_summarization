 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of dislodged pigtail
 catheter, evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable view of the chest were obtained.  No definite
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  There are right greater than left bibasilar
 opacities that may be due to atelectasis, although consolidation is not
 excluded.  Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic angle suggests trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  A single-lead right-sided pacemaker is unchanged in position.
