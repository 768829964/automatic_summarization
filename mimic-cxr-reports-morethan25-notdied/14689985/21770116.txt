 HISTORY:  Fever of unknown origin.  Evaluate for source of fever.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and CT chest from ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate normal heart size. 
 Single lead right-sided pacemaker is in unchanged positioning.  Midline
 tracheostomy tube is seen.  There is a small to moderate left pleural effusion
 with overlying atelectasis.  There is increased opacity in the superior
 segment of the left lower lobe compared to the prior radiographs, but this is
 similar to possibly mildly increased compared to the ___ CT, ongoing
 infectious process is not excluded.  Right basilar linear atelectasis/
 scarring is unchanged.  No pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are stable.
