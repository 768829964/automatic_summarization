                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a
 right subclavian PICC line that extends to the mid-to-lower portion of the
 SVC.  Tracheostomy tube and cardiac monitor lead remain in place.
 
 The area of increased opacification at the left base has substantially
 cleared.  Nevertheless, the left hemidiaphragm is obscured, consistent with
 some substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 
 Remainder of the heart and lungs is unchanged.
