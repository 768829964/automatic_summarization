                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again poor
 definition of the left hemidiaphragm consistent with substantial volume loss
 in the left lower lobe.  Blunting of the costophrenic angle persists, which
 could reflect pleural fluid.  In the appropriate clinical setting, supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in good position and the right pacemaker device
 extends to the apex of the right pulmonary artery.
