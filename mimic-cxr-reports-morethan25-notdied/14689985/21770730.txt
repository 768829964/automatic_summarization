                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with shortness of breath and history of recent
 pneumonia.  Evaluate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal upright and lateral chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Diffuse patchy opacities throughout the left lung are significantly
 improved compared with ___.  The degree of left lower lobe aeration
 also appears improved.  The right lung is unchanged in appearance, with some
 linear opacities across the right lung base and coarse interstitial markings
 likely secondary to chronic nonspecific fibrotic changes.  A small left-sided
 pleural effusion is again seen.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  A tracheostomy tube and
 left-sided pacemaker are again seen and unchanged in position compared with
 prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement in the degree of inflammatory involvement of
 the left lung as well as left lower lobe aeration.
