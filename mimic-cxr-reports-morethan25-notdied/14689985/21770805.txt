                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ years old man with tracheostomy, desaturation to 70s,
 assess for mucus plug.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable semi-erect chest x-ray shows stable position of
 tracheostomy tube; unnchanged right pectoral pacemaker with single lead
 following the expected course and ending in the right ventricle.  Compared to
 prior chest x-ray, there are little changes with stable left lung base opacity
 due to the left lower lobe atelectasis.  Linear opacities at the right lung
 base are minimally increased, likely due to linear atelectasis. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusion is unchanged.
