 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has received a
 tracheostomy tube.  The tube is correctly positioned.  The right pectoral
 pacemaker is unchanged.  No evidence of complications, notably no
 pneumothorax.  Unchanged normal size of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral
 areas of basal atelectasis, likely to be caused by radiographically unchanged
 bilateral pleural effusions.  No newly appeared parenchymal opacities.  No
 radiographic evidence of pulmonary edema.
