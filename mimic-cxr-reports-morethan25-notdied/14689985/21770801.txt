                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status, dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Left
 costophrenic angle is not fully included on the image.  Single-lead
 right-sided pacemaker is again seen, unchanged in position.  Tracheostomy is
 also unchanged.  Patchy opacities projecting over the left lung are grossly
 stable since the prior study, but improved as compared to ___.  There is
 also persistent scarring/atelectasis at the right costophrenic angle.  Trace
 bilateral pleural effusions are difficult to exclude and may be present.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable, as are the hilar contours.
