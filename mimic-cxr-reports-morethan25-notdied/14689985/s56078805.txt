                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Assessment is limited by patient rotation and positioning. Tracheostomy tube
 terminates in unchanged position.  Right-sided pacemaker device is again noted
 with single lead terminating in the right ventricle.  Multiple clips project
 over the mediastinum.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours appear similar with
 leftward shift of the mediastinal structures, unchanged. Dense retrocardiac
 opacity likely reflects a combination of known left lower lobe chronic
 bronchiectasis and collapse, worse when compared to the previous radiograph.
 Patchy opacities in the left upper lung field and peripheral aspect of the
 right mid lung field appear relatively similar compared to the previous
 radiograph.  Patchy opacities in the right lung base are new, worrisome for
 infection or aspiration. Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. New right basilar patchy opacity concerning for pneumonia or aspiration.
 2. Persistent ill-defined opacities in the left upper lobe and peripheral
 aspect of the right mid lung field, worrisome for additional sites of
 infection or aspiration which appear more chronic.
 3. Dense retrocardiac opacity likely reflecting a combination of unknown
 bronchiectasis and lung collapse.
 4. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
