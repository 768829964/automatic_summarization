 Tracheostomy tube is in stable position terminating in the mid thoracic
 trachea.  There has been waxing and waning opacity in the left base since
 about ___.  Compared to the next most recent study 10 days ago,
 the left base is better aerated with some residual opacity and blunting of the
 costophrenic sulcus.  There is chronic streaky atelectasis at the right base. 
 No new focal airspace consolidation is detected.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette and hilar contours are stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of the left lower lobe with some residual
 patchy opacity and blunting of the left costophrenic sulcus.  No new focal
 airspace consolidation.
