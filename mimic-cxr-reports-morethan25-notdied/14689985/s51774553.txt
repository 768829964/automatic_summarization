                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with resolving pneumonia  // eval infiltrate
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube projects over the superior mediastinum at the midline. A
 right-sided pacemaker with single lead is unchanged in position. Heart size is
 normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal, and stable.
 Asymmetric, ill defined opacity noted in the left lung raises potential
 concern for multifocal pneumonia, though a component of scarring or
 atelectasis may contribute.. Note is made of some basilar opacities,
 suggestive of atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetric, ill defined opacity noted in the left lung raises potential
 concern for multifocal pneumonia, though a component of scarring or
 atelectasis may contribute to this appearance.
