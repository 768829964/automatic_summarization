                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent neurosurgery with low-grade fever, tachycardia.  Rule out
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___, there has been
 interval removal of a right-sided subclavian central venous catheter. 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in standard position. The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.  The lungs are well-expanded.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is decreased opacity of the
 right lung base. Subtle left lung base opacity persists and could relate to
 aspiration.  
 
 IMPRESSION: Subtle left basilar opacity could represent aspiration.
