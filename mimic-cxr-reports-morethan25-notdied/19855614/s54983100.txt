                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Failure to extubate, now re-intubated, check for placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tip of the endotracheal tube is at the lower clavicular level,
 approximately 5 cm above the carina.  The right IJ catheter appears somewhat
 more caudal than previously and could well be in the upper portion of the
 right atrium.  Otherwise, little change.
