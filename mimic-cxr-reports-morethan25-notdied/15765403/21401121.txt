                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with shortness of breath, evaluate for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema have improved compared
 with the prior study.  Marked cardiomegaly is persistent but likely slightly
 improved as well.  Bibasilar opacities likely represent atelectasis, however
 superimposed consolidation cannot be excluded.  Tracheostomy tube is
 unchanged.  Left PICC terminates at the origin of the SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Slight interval improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary
 edema.
 2. Persistent bibasilar opacities may represent atelectasis or consolidation.
