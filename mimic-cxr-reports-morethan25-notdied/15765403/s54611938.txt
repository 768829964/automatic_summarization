                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with VAP  // Interval change of chest
 infiltrates
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The heart is severely enlarged, and is larger than on the prior study.  There
 is no significant change in the tracheostomy tube or PICC line.  There is
 marked improvement in the aeration in the right lower lobe, however there is
 some persistent alveolar infiltrate in the right lower lobe.  The right heart
 border is very distinctly visualized suggesting that there may be a small
 amount of pneumomediastinum.  The right effusion is decreased.  There is
 increased obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm with dense retrocardiac
 opacity compatible with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion.  This is worsened
 compared to the study from 2 days ago.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased cardiomegaly, some improved aeration in the right lower lobe but
 worsened appearance to a left lower lobe.  Sharp margin of the right heart
 border suggests an element of pneumomediastinum
