                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with left PICC // Repeat CXR to confirm L PICC
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph obtained 2 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A left PICC is likely terminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic vein
 and SVC.  Increased retrocardiac opacity and apparent leftward mediastinal
 shift suggests increasing left lower lobe atelectasis.  Otherwise, no
 significant change compared to 2 hours prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. A left PICC likely terminates at the confluence of the left brachiocephalic
 vein and SVC.
 2. Increased retrocardiac opacity and apparent leftward mediastinal shift
 suggests increasing left lower lobe atelectasis.  Superimposed infection
 cannot be ruled out. Recommend follow-up radiographs ensuring optimum patient
 positioning.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 2:51 PM, approximately
 20 minutes after discovery of the findings.
