  to portable nature of the study.  A dedicated upright PA and lateral views can
  be obtained to fully assess.  Upon discussion with the ordering physician,
  given ___ current condition, dedicated upright PA and lateral cannot be
  obtained.  As a result short interval interval follow-up with repeat
  radiograph in the morning seems reasonable as the patient is clinically
  stable. Left-sided PICC line now terminates in the upper SVC/confluence of the
  bilateral brachiocephalic veins.  The findings and recommendations regarding
  the lucency were discussed with Dr. ___, ___D. by ___, ___D.
  on the telephone on ___ at 9:___ PM, ___ minutes after discovery of the
