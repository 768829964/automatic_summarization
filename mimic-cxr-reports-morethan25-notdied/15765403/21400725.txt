                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (AP AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F presents with hypoxia from assisted living. Denies
 infectious symptoms but questionable historian.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are slightly reduced compared to the previous study.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly appears mildly increased, potentially accentuated by wound lower
 lung volumes.  Re- demonstrated is enlargement of both pulmonary arteries
 compatible with underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.  Mild pulmonary
 edema is demonstrated, without focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormality is visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with moderate cardiomegaly.  Bilateral hilar enlargement
 compatible with underlying pulmonary arterial hypertension.
