                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated on transfer from outside hospital.  Evaluate endotracheal
 tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is in place, projecting 3.3 cm cranial to the
 carina in standard position.  Lung volumes are extremely low, with elevation
 of the right hemidiaphragm, exaggerating the cardiac silhouette and the
 pulmonary vasculature.  There is associated compressive atelectasis,
 underlying aspiration not excluded.  The lungs appear otherwise clear.  There
 is no large effusion or pneumothorax.  An NG tube passes into the stomach out
 of field of imaging.
