                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with recent tracheostomy.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ .
 
 The tracheostomy is in place.  The apical pneumothorax on the left appears to
 be slightly decreased potentially due to re-expanding of the lung.  There is
 also decrease in the left chest wall air.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema
 is unchanged, associated with bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal
 atelectasis.
