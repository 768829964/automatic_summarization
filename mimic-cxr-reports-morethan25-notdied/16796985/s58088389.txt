                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:48 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with recent thoracotomy.  Evaluate lines and tubes
 and cardiopulmonary changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___.
 
 Left pleural fluid is still considerable despite the multiplicity of pleural
 drains.  There is no pneumothorax.  Left basal atelectasis is substantial, but
 there is good aeration in the upper lung.  On the right, vasculature is
 congested and the previous consolidative abnormality in the mid lung has
 nearly resolved.  Skinfold should not be mistaken for a pneumothorax.  Mild
 cardiomegaly unchanged.  ET tube and left internal jugular line are in
 standard placements, while an upper enteric drainage tube ends in the upper
 stomach and would need to be advanced several centimeters to move all the side
 ports beyond the GE junction.
