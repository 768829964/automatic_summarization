                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with left pleural effusion, history of
 complicated left pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar study of ___.  Status post sternotomy and moderate
 cardiac enlargement as before.  The previously described loculated
 pneumothorax on the left side remains rather unchanged.  The air-fluid level
 within the pneumothorax is at a slightly higher level indicating filling-in of
 the isolated cavity.  There may be some improved aeration in the area of the
 previously identified trapped left lower lung, but aCT-chest exam would be
 required to make such observation conclusively.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Grossly stable chest findings with left-sided loculated
 pneumothorax and trapped lung.
