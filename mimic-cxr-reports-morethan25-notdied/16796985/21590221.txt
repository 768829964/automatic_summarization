                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 15:15.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post AVR and CABG, evaluate pleural
 effusions.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 13:37.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film of ___ at 15:15 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval extubation and removal of the right internal jugular Swan-Ganz
 catheter.  Mediastinal drains and left basilar chest tube remain in place. 
 Interval removal of the nasogastric tube.
 
 2.  Small bilateral effusions with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities likely
 reflecting atelectasis.  Some other scattered linear opacities in the right
 and left mid lung likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Right internal jugular introducer sheath
 remains in place.  Status post median sternotomy with stable postoperative
 cardiac and mediastinal contours, given differences in patient positioning and
 lung volumes.  Prominent amount of gas within the distended stomach.
