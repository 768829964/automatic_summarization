                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left pigtail pleural catheter has been placed laterally in the left
 mid hemithorax.  A previously present loculated left lateral pneumothorax has
 been largely replaced by loculated pleural fluid, but there is an apparent
 residual loculated hydropneumothorax adjacent to the left heart border in the
 lower left hemithorax.  Stable cardiomegaly accompanied by pulmonary vascular
 congestion and moderate pulmonary edema.  Moderate layering right pleural
 effusion is again demonstrated.
