 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION: status post VATS.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the nasogastric tube and
 the endotracheal tube have been removed.  Lung volumes have minimally
 decreased, with increased radiodensity at both lung zones.  However, no acute
 changes appear to be present.  The postoperative pleural changes with the
 accompanying parenchymal component on the left are constant in appearance and
 severity.
