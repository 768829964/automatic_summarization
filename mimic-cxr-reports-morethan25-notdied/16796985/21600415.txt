                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest tube on waterseal.
 
 Comparison is made with the prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly, widened mediastinum are stable.  Lines and tubes are in
 standard positions.  There is no pneumothorax.  Large left pleural effusion
 and adjacent perihilar and left lower lobe opacities are grossly unchanged. 
 Right lower lobe opacity has increased consistent with increasing atelectasis
 and small-to-moderate effusion.  Mild vascular congestion is minimally
 improved.
