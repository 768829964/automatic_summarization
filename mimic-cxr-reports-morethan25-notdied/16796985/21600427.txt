                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Questionable aspiration, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the known pleural and
 parenchymal opacities on the left are unchanged.  Also unchanged is the size
 of the cardiac silhouette.  A pre-existing subtle opacity at the right lung
 base, however, has increased in ___.  Although this change might be
 artificial and caused by slight patient rotation, the area should receive
 attention on further followup, to exclude developing pneumonia.  Unchanged
 right PICC line.  A feeding tube has been inserted in the interval.  The
 course and position of the tube are normal.
