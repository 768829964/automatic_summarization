                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 8:13 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post thoracotomy status post trach. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 11:15.
 
 A portable AP upright chest from ___ at 8:13 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position.  Stable cardiac and
 mediastinal contour status post median sternotomy for CABG.  There is a stable
 loculated left apical lateral pneumothorax.  Overall, there is increasing
 airspace opacity within the lungs which more likely reflects worsening
 pulmonary edema, although an infectious process could also have this
 appearance.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Loculated air within the left
 lateral chest wall soft tissues is seen consistent with subcutaneous
 emphysema.
