                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 609  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with ventilator dependence, difficulty
 weaning, status post trach, evaluate pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 609 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line and tracheostomy tube are unchanged in
 position.  Loculated left pneumothorax is unchanged.  There continue to be
 layering bilateral effusions with patchy bibasilar airspace opacities which
 could reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration should also be
 considered.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable status post
 median sternotomy for CABG.  There is a decreasing amount of air within the
 left lateral chest wall soft tissues.  No overt pulmonary edema.
