 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after ___ ___ aortic valve
 replacement, abdominal aortic aneurysm and left iliac artery aneurysm repair,
 after chest tube placement and presence of trapped lung.
 
 PA and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 There is loculated pneumothorax noted in the left chest wall with large
 loculation associated with multiple small air-fluid levels.  The findings
 might be consistent with non-simple pleural effusion.  There is adjacent
