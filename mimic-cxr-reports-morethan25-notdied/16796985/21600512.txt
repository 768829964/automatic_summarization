                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post thoracotomy and decortication. 
 Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A tracheostomy tube and right approach central
 venous catheter are in unchanged expected position.  Median sternotomy wires
 appear intact.  Overall, aeration of the left lung with areas of loculated
 left pleural air appear unchanged.  A small amount of left chest wall air is
 also stable.  Right lower lobe opacity, likely a combination of atelectasis
 and moderate effusion is unchanged.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Overall similar appearance of the left hemithorax status post thoracotomy
 and decortication.
 2.  Unchanged probable right lower lobe atelectasis and moderate effusion.
