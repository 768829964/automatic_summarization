                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:51 P.M. ON ___   
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with hemothorax, post-op.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to earlier in the day.  Opacification at the
 periphery of the left hemithorax is probably a fluid collection, conceivably
 hemothorax, which has collected despite three left pleural drains.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  Left lung is largely atelectatic, but the right lung is
 clear.  Heart is top normal size.  Patient rotation makes it hard to say
 whether the new left pleural collection is responsible for rightward
 mediastinal shift.
