                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 6:09
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure, evaluate for known
 pneumonia and ARDS.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 10:21.
 
 A portable AP upright chest film ___ at 6:09 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right subclavian PICC line and tracheostomy tube are unchanged in
 position.  There is no change in appearance of the left hemithorax where there
 is a loculated left pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema within the chest
 wall soft tissues.  There is a small layering right effusion which does not
 appear to have reaccumulated.  There has been some interval improvement in the
 interstitial edema.  Retrocardiac consolidation persists with associated
 pleural effusion and may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia or aspiration
 should also be considered.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable in this postoperative patient status post median sternotomy for CABG.
