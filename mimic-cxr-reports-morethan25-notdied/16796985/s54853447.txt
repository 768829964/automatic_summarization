                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with are vent dependent respiratory and
 insufficiency.  Evaluate interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube which terminates
 3.5 cm above the level of the carina in appropriate position.  A feeding tube
 ends in the distal nondistended stomach.  A right PICC terminates in in the
 right atrium.  For repositioning with confidence within the low superior vena
 cava, this line would need to be pulled 6 cm. 
 
 There is persistent left moderate size pneumothorax which appears largely this
 same with increasing subcutaneous air along the lateral thoracic wall. 
 Dependent pulmonary edema and associated pleural effusion within the right
 lung appears worse, making any focal consolidation recently in question
 difficult to appreciate.  
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette has a normal postoperative appearance.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent left moderate size pneumothorax with increasing subcutaneous air
 along the lateral thoracic wall. 
 
 Increased pulmonary edema and pleural effusion within the right lung.
