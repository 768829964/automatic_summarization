 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:16 PM
  Dobbhoff terminates within the ___ portion the duodenum.  Unchanged elevation
  left hemidiaphragm with overlying atelectasis and probable small pleural
  effusion.  There is worsened pulmonary edema, moderate.  Left subclavian
  catheter in satisfactory position.  Findings paged to Dr. ___.
  
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, now
 status post Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent from
 ___.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A Dobbhoff catheter courses below the
 diaphragm, crosses midline, and terminates in the region of the gastroduodenal
 junction.  There is increased opacity within the left lung base, which likely
 reflects increasing pleural fluid.  There is increased pulmonary vascular
 congestion as compared to most recent prior examination, though no overt
 interstitial edema.  Mediastinal and hilar contours appear similar to prior. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobbhoff catheter at the gastroduodenal junction.
 2.  Probable mild increase in moderate left pleural effusion.
