                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, to assess for pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the opacification at the left
 base has decreased, consistent with improvement of the pleural effusion and
 probably the degree of volume loss in the left lower lobe.  Mild residual
 atelectasis and possibly small pleural effusion on the right.
 
 The monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
