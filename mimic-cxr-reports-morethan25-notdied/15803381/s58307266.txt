                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Evaluate for effusions.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 17:35 p.m.
 
 An ET tube is present, carina is not well delineated, but the tip of the tube
 lies approximately 7 cm above the carina.  An NG tube appears to be present,
 but is poorly delineated and therefore difficult to trace below the diaphragm.
 Right IJ central line is present, tip in the region of the proximal SVC. A
 left IJ central line tip overlies the left brachiocephalic vein immediately
 proximal to its confluence with the SVC.  
 
 There is probable background COPD.  There are increased vascular markings,
 consistent with CHF.  There is left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation,
 with a small left effusion.  There is probable atelectasis at the right base
 and minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.   There is probable
 cardiomegaly.  The left hilum is very prominent.  The aorta is calcified.
 Incidental note made of old resection of the distal left clavicle, with
 well-corticated edges.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Lines and tubes as described.  Please see comment above.
 2.  Probable background COPD.  
 3.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation with small effusion, similar
 to one day earlier.
 4.  Increased vascular and interstitial markings, grossly unchanged.  This may
 reflect CHF with interstitial edema.  The possibility of background
 interstitial disease cannot be entirely excluded.
 5.  Large left hilum with a tapered appearance, ? due to pulmonary
 hypertension.
