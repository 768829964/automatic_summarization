                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post AAA repair, evaluate for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to immediate prior exam, there has been little interval
 change except for interval placement of a Dobbhoff tube with the majority of
 the tube is coiled within the cervical esophagus and the tip terminating just
 proximal to the GE junction.  There is otherwise stable positioning of a right
 internal jugular Swan-Ganz catheter.  Positioning of endotracheal tube is
 difficult to ascertain with multiple loops of coiling of the Dobbhoff tube
 within the cervical esophagus.  There is otherwise unchanged cardiomediastinal
 silhouette, bilateral layering pleural effusions and moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Coiling of Dobbhoff tube within the cervical esophagus with tip
 just proximal to the GE junction.  Otherwise, no significant interval change.
