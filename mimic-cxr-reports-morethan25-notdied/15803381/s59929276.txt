                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachypnea and low saturation, to assess for lung collapse.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of earlier in this date, the monitoring
 and support devices remain in place.  Continued opacification at the left base
 is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural effusion. 
 Indistinctness of prominent pulmonary vessels is consistent with elevated
 pulmonary venous pressure.
