                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  aortic repair, evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal
 improvement of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities, with improved
 ventilation, notably at the right lung base.  The left lung base, including
 the retrocardiac atelectasis and the small pleural effusion, is unchanged. 
 The previously coiled nasogastric tube is the esophagus has been pulled, a new
 nasogastric tube can be followed to the level of the mid-to-lower esophagus
 but is not visible more distally.  The other monitoring and support devices
 are constant.  No pneumothorax.
