                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage and cardiac arrest, status post a
 right-sided craniotomy.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 5:12.  Chest radiograph
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is in satisfactory position, 4 cm from the
 carina.  An enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip in the
 stomach.  A feeding Dobhoff tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip out
 of the field of view in the postpyloric position within the jejunum.  A
 right-sided internal jugular central venous catheter is in unchanged position
 with the tip in the upper-to-mid SVC.  The borderline pulmonary edema has
 cleared from the right upper lung.  Bibasilar atelectasis is slightly worse,
 particularly in the retrocardiac region.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Resolution of borderline pulmonary edema.
 2.  Slight interval increase in bibasilar atelectasis.
 3.  Satisfactory position of multiple support tubes and lines.
