                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post tracheostomy, orogastric
 tube replaced, confirm appropriate position and rule out complications.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study ___ ___.  A tracheostomy cannula is seen in place apparently to
 substitute for the previously present ETT.  The cannula is in appropriate
 position, terminating in the trachea some 4 cm above the level of the carina. 
 No pneumothorax is seen.  NG tube is identified, seen to pass well below the
 diaphragm and through the stomach with its distal end, assuming the curvature
 of the pancreas head, terminating in the proximal jejunum.  This appears to be
 in similar position as a tube identified on ___, although its distal
 termination is not completely identified in the previous examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  OG tube reaching proximal jejunum.  No significant changes in
 chest finding, short of conversion from ETT to tracheostomy with cannula.
