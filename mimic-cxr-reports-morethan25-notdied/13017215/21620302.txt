                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval removal of nasogastric tube with standard position of
 remaining endotracheal tube and central venous catheter.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  Heterogeneous opacities in the right lung have slightly
 improved in the interval, and remain most confluent in the right lower lobe. 
 These findings are likely due to multifocal infection, accompanied by a
 small-to-moderate right pleural effusion.
