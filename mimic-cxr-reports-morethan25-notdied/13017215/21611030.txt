                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, tracheostomy tube remains in
 place.  Allowing for different degree of obliquity of the patient, there is
 probably little change in the appearance of the heart and mediastinum.  Again
 there is some evidence of increased pulmonary venous pressure.  Retrocardiac
 opacification is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and small
 effusion.
