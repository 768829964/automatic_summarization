                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube and right PICC are unchanged in position, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for marked rotation on the
 current study.  Previously reported pulmonary edema has improved with residual
 mild edema remaining.  Bibasilar atelectasis has also slightly improved along
 with decreasing pleural effusions, now small in size.
