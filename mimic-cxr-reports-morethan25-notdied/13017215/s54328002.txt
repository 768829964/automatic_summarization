                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  SAH, multiple cardiac arrests, febrile, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR from ___ at 4:29 a.m.
 
 Rotated positioning.  An ET tube is present.  The tip lies at the upper edge
 of the medial clavicular heads, approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  Two
 enteric tubes are present, both extending beneath the diaphragm off the film. 
 A right IJ central line is present, likely unchanged, overlying the proximal
 SVC.  
 
 Allowing for differences in positioning, I doubt significant interval change. 
 Again seen is increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.  A possible small left effusion cannot be
 excluded.  The right lung is grossly clear, without CHF, frank consolidation
 or effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Allowing for differences in positioning, I doubt significant
 change compared with ___ at 4:29 a.m.
