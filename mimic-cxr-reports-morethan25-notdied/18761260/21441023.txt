 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Status post trauma with question fever and pneumonia.
 
 REFERENCE EXAM:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are slightly lower than on the prior study.  There
 continues to be pulmonary vascular redistribution and obscuration of both
 hemidiaphragms.  This can be due to volume loss/effusion/infiltrate. 
 Tracheostomy tube and right IJ line are unchanged.  Compared to the prior
 study, the appearance of the lungs is slightly worse.
