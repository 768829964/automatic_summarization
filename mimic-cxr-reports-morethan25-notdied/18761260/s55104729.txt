                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Tracheostomy after motor vehicle collision, now presenting with
 increased confusion and thickened sputum.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line terminates at the confluence of the brachiocephalic
 veins of the superior vena cava, and the patient is again status post
 tracheostomy.  The heart appears enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear unchanged.  There is a diffuse mild vascular prominence with indistinct
 vascular and interstitial markings suggesting mild congestion.  Patchy
 retrocardiac opacity is minor and probably attributable to atelectasis.  There
 is no definite pleural effusion although noting that the left costophrenic
 sulcus is partly excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings most suggestive of mild vascular congestion without
 definite pneumonia.  Patchy retrocardiac opacity appears minor and may be
 associated with coinciding atelectasis.  If concern for the possibility of
 pneumonia persists, however, then short-term followup radiographs could be
 considered, preferably with PA and lateral technique if feasible.
