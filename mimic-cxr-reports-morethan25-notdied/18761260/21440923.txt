                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post motor vehicle collision with bilateral ankle
 fracture, aggressively resuscitated.  To look for interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest view was reviewed in comparison with
 prior radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Monitoring and supporting devices are in standard position.  Mild
 to moderately severe pulmonary edema has symmetrically improved on the right
 side, but unchanged on the left side.  Bilateral small pleural effusions are
 presumed.  Retrocardiac density is increased since ___, reflecting
 an increased left lower lung atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Over last 24 hours mild to moderately severe pulmonary edema has
 symmetrically improved on the right side and unchanged on the left side. 
 Bilateral small pleural effusions are presumed.
