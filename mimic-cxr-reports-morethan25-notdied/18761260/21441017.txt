                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old with tracheostomy and hypoxia after suctioning,
 assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from earlier the same date as well as CT from
 two hours prior.
 
 SUPINE PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH:  Tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position. 
 Bilateral pulmonary opacities are more pronounced than the recent comparison
 radiograph; given the interval change this could reflect edema or aspiration
 superimposed upon the atelectasis and effusion seen on chest CT. The right
 upper lung opacity on chest CT is not as well seen on these films in part due
 to external material projecting over the right lateral upper chest.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiac size is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Worsened opacities likely due to edema without change to atelectasis and
 effusion as on chest CT. Concomitant infectious process would be difficult to
 exclude.
