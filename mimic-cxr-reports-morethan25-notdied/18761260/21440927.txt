 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single PA upright chest view was read in comparison with multiple
 prior radiographs, with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Over last 24 hours, worsened left mid and lower lung opacities is
 concerning for aspiration pneumonia, give prior aspiration changes as
 reflected by radiograph sequence between ___ and ___. Mild
 opacity in the right lower lung likely from atelectasis or aspiration is
 unchanged since yesterday.  Top normal heart size, mediastinal and hilar
 contours have been stable.  Tip of the endotracheal tube ends approximately
 3.5 cm above the carina and is appropriate.  Right internal jugular line
