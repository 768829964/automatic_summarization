                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pneumothorax and new o2 requirement  //
 pneumothorax and ?reason for new O2 requirement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The chest radiograph dated ___ shows a slight change in the position
 of the left apical chest tube, which now terminates at the superior border of
 the left clavicle. The right subclavian central venous line is unchanged,
 terminating in low SVC.  The slightly bent appearance of the line where it
 enters the chest wall is unchanged.  Aeration of the left lung has
 substantially improved with re-expansion of the lung and resultant rightward
 shift of the heart and mediastinum. The right lung remains clear.  There is a
 small residual left pneumothorax.  Metallic foreign bodies are again noted.
 
 The followup radiograph dated ___ shows increased left lung
 atelectasis, and a persistent moderate left pneumothorax. There is no other
 significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Initial re-expansion of the left lung with associated left lung atelectasis
 improved on the ___ radiograph, but worsened on the initial ___
 radiograph. There is still substantial left lung atelectasis and a moderate
 size left pneumothorax.
