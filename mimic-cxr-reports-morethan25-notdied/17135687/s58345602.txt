                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ with 4 GSW to the chest, hemopnuemothorax s/p bilateral
 chest tubes, T4 SC injury with paraplegia  // interval change     interval
 change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is further decrease in
 opacification in the left hemithorax, cysts consistent with progressive
 improvement in the pleural effusion. However, it is possible that this midst
 merely reflects a more erect position of the patient. Retrocardiac
 opacification again is consistent with substantial volume loss in the left
 lower lobe.
 The remainder of the study is unchanged with no evidence of pneumothorax.
