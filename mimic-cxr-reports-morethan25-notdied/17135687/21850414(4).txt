                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/ GSW x 4 to chest; intubated, s/p BL CT w/ initial output
 approx 1 L w/ severe T4 injury  // respiratory distress in patient with CT;
 interval change; please eval for PTX change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Biapical pneumothoraces, left greater than right are unchanged. A right
 subclavian central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC. Left apical
 chest tube remains in place. Leftward deviation of the heart and mediastinum
 is unchanged.  A focal airspace opacity in the right upper lobe may be due to
 focally edema versus hemorrhage. Increased retrocardiac opacification is
 likely due to worsening left lung atelectasis.  Multiple metallic foreign
 bodies are in keeping with the stated history of gunshot wound.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Stable biapical pneumothoraces, left greater than right.
 Increasing left lung atelectasis.
 Stable focal right upper lobe focally edema versus hemorrhage.
