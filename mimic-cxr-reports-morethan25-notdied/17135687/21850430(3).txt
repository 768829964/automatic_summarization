                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with R pneumothorax, s/p pigtail  // improvement
 of R pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to prior radiograph of 1 day earlier, small right apical
 pneumothorax is a persistent finding with right pigtail pleural catheter in
 place, with a slightly changed position compared to the prior exam. Appearance
 of the lungs is remarkable for worsening asymmetrical confluent opacities in
 the left perihilar and both lower lobes as well as development of small
 pleural effusions, left greater than right.
