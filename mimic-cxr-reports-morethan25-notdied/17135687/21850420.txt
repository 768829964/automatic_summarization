                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  HISTORY OF RECENT GUNSHOT WOUNDS WITH BILATERAL CHEST TUBES.
 TACHYPNEIC WITH DESATURATION.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy is in place. Bullet fracture fragments are again noted
 bilaterally. Bilateral chest tubes are unchanged in positions. A right-sided
 pneumothorax has increased and is now small to moderate in size. There is no
 definite pleural effusion on the left. Vague retrocardiac opacity is similar
 and suggests atelectasis, but improved substantially.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increase in right-sided pneumothorax, now small to moderate, with mild
 recurrent leftward shift.  Discussed with ___ by telephone.
