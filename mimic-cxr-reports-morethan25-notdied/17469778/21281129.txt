 COMPARISON:  ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  
 
 ET tube ends 5.8 cm above the carina.  Left lower lung opacities are mainly

 recent CT.  This is unchanged.  Right moderate basal atelectasis is also
 unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Dobbhoff tube is below the diaphragm. 
 Remaining of the lungs are unremarkable.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are
 normal.
