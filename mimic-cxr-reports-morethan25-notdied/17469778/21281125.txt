                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old intubated patient whose ETT has moved.  Question
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph dated ___ and CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates ET tube extending to
 4.7 cm above the carina.  A left subclavian approach dual lumen central venous
 catheter is stable in position with tip terminating in the lower SVC.  The
 heart is top-normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are stable. 
 There is a similar appearance of the left lower lobe collapse and concurrent
 pleural effusion, better delineated on prior CT.  Linear atelectasis in the
 right middle lobe and lower lobe.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or
 right pleural effusion. 
  
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET tube in appropriate position.
