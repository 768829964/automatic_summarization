                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON STUDY:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval extubation.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal
 limits and without change.  Layering moderate left pleural effusion has
 apparently increased in size and is accompanied by worsening left retrocardiac
 opacity, suggestive of atelectasis.  Minor atelectatic changes are present in
 the right lower lobe, with otherwise clear right lung, and no evidence of a
 right pleural effusion.
