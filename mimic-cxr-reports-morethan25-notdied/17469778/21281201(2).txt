                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Strep pneumonia with intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been placement of a
 large-bore catheter from the right IJ region that extends into the right
 atrium.  Otherwise, the monitoring and support devices are essentially
 unchanged.  Hazy opacification in the left hemithorax is consistent with
 substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe with some layering pleural
 effusion.  Mild atelectatic changes are again seen at the right base. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
