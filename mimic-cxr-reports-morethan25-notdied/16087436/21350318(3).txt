                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 21:30
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with IPH and respiratory failure, check ET
 tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 13:41.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 9:35 p.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There has been interval placement of endotracheal tube, which has its tip 3.7
 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is again seen coursing below the
 diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Overall lung volumes remain stable,
 but there is indistinctness of the pulmonary vascularity suggestive of
 worsening interstitial pulmonary edema.  More focal patchy opacities at both
 bases, left greater than right, may reflect atelectasis, although pneumonia
 cannot be entirely excluded.  No pneumothorax.  Biapical pleural thickening is
 again seen.  Possible small bilateral layering effusions.  Overall, cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in positioning
 between studies.
