                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Respiratory distress, rising oxygen requirement.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with no prior studies
 available for comparison.
 
 Heart size is enlarged.  Widening of the mediastinum most likely reflect fat
 deposition.  Bilateral consolidations most likely represent areas of
 atelectasis although infection cannot be excluded.  No appreciable fluid is
 seen although small amount cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.
