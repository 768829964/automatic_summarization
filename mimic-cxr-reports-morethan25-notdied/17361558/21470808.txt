                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Trauma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ at 17:  ___ and CT torso ___
 at 18: ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The right-sided chest tube has been removed.  There continues to be extensive
 subcutaneous emphysema tracking within the right chest wall and neck.  Known
 small right pneumothorax is not well delineated on the current exam.  Small
 amount of pneumomediastinum is similar.  Patchy ill-defined opacities within
 the right lung likely reflect areas of contusion with atelectasis.  Patchy
 opacity in left lung base likely reflects atelectasis.  Trace bilateral
 pleural effusions are re- demonstrated.  Multiple bilateral rib fractures are
 better delineated on the recent CT.
