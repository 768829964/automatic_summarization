                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Polytrauma.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 3.6 cm above
 the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film.
 
 Right IJ central line tip overlies distal SVC.  Right and left chest tubes
 present.
 
 There is mild prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, similar to ___ at 6:02 a.m.  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular
 blurring, with areas of more confluent alveolar opacity at both lung bases. 
 There is a probable right effusion with obscuration of the right
 hemidiaphragm.  
 
 There are multiple rib fractures, most distinct along the right posterior
 chest.  A small-to-moderate size right pneumothorax is noted, tracking along
 the right chest wall into the right lung apex.   The right pneumothorax
 appears larger than on the film from ___ at 6:02 a.m. No definite
 left-sided pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Lines and tubes, as described.
 2.  Opacities at both lung bases, with presumed right effusion.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, the differential diagnosis includes pneumonia,
 hemorrhage, atypical distribution of alveolar edema, or ARDS.  
 3.  Small-to-moderate size right pneumothorax, larger than on ___ at 6:02
 a.m.
