                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Arrest, pneumonia, evaluation for pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is minimally improved
 ventilation of the right lung, with subsequent decrease in extent of the right
 pleural effusion.  The left, the pleural effusion and retrocardiac and left
