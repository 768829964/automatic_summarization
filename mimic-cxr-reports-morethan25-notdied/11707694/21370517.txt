                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:26 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Check PIC placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New left PIC line ends in the low SVC.  Left jugular line tip is at the origin
 of the SVC.  Combination of right lower lobe collapse and right pleural
 effusion is unchanged.  Major interval development, read in conjunction with a
 subsequent radiograph performed at 5:21 p.m., but available at the time of
 this review, shows substantial increase in left pleural effusion and severe
 atelectasis involving nearly all of the left lung.  No pneumothorax.
