                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine portable chest view was read in comparison with most recent
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Both lung volumes are low.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard
 position.  Increased retrocardiac density reflecting left lower lung
 atelectasis is unchanged since yesterday.  Mild right basal atelectasis has
 improved.  Bilateral small pleural effusions appear similar.  No new lung
 opacities of concern moderately enlarged heart size, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Over last 24 hours increased retrocardiac opacity reflecting
 consolidation and/or atelectasis is unchanged whereas improved right lower
 lung opacity is atelectasis.  Presumed bilateral small pleural effusions are
 stable.
