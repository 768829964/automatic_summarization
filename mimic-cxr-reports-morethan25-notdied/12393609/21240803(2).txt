                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia, to assess for any interval
 changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was reviewed in comparison with
 prior chest radiographs through ___ with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Since prior radiograph acquired 24 hours apart, there is no significant
 interval changes in the radiographic findings.  Monitoring and supporting
 devices are in standard position.  Endotracheal tube ends approximately 5.6 cm
 above the carina and is appropriate.  Feeding tube is seen to course below the
 diaphragm into the stomach, however, with its distal end curled into the
 fundus of the stomach.  Right internal jugular line ends at upper SVC. 
 Bilateral lung volumes remain low.  Bibasilar opacities, left side more than
 right side which represents atelectasis and associated effusion is similar. 
 Assessment of mediastinal and hilar status and its comparison with prior
 radiograph was limited due to rotation of patient.  No new lung opacities of
 concern.
