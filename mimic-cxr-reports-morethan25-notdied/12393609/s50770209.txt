                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Occlusion of proximal part of vertebral artery and
 distal area of basilar artery, respiratory distress.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The NG tube passes below the diaphragm as well as the feeding tube, not
 clearly seen on the current study.  The ET tube tip is most likely inserted, 6
 cm above the carina tip location.  Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged. 
 There is interval progression of bibasilar opacities, most likely reflecting
 worsening atelectasis in combination with interval development of
 mild-to-moderate interstitial pulmonary edema.  Reevaluation after diuresis is
 required.
