                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST ON ___ AT 17:19
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cough and shortness of breath, question
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 6:28.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest on ___ at 17:19 are submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is a subtle asymmetry
 at the right base as compared to the left, but no corresponding abnormality is
 seen on the lateral projection and therefore this could reflect asymmetry in
 the overlying soft tissues rather than representing an early pneumonia.  If
 the patient's symptoms persist, followup imaging would be advised.  No pleural
 effusions, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  No acute bony abnormality.
