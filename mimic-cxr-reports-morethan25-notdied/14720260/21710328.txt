 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with RLL PNA frebile despite cap anx  // eval for
 interval change, frebile despite xray
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A large area of pneumonia in the right lower lobe has become less radiodense
 than, it was on ___, but is still substantial. Conventional chest
 radiographs would be helpful in monitoring its progress, when feasible.
 
 Milder consolidation at the base of the left lung could be atelectasis. The
 heart is borderline enlarged, and upper lobe pulmonary vasculature is mildly
 distended, but there is as yet no pulmonary edema. Some bilateral pleural
 effusion is presumed, but probably not significant. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement.  Right jugular line ends centrally, a
