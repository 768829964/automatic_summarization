 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with sdh*** WARNING *** Multiple patients with same
 last name!  // acute prpocess      .  History provided for head CT also
 ordered today refers to SDH.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 The distal tip of the ET tube is not well delineated due to overlying sternal
 wires, but likely lies approximately 7.3 cm above the carina, just below the
 medial clavicular heads on this lordotic view.  NG tube tip extends beneath
 the diaphragm and overlies the upper stomach.  If a side-port is present, it
 does not clearly extend beyond the GE junction.
 
 Heart is not enlarged.  Sternotomy wires are noted.  The aorta is calcified
 and slightly unfolded.
 
 No CHF, focal infiltrate or effusion is identified.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes as described.  If the NG tube has side-port, it does not
 clearly extend distal to the GE junction.
 
  No acute pulmonary process identified.
