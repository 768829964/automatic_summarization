                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with SDH, trach dependent, pneumonia  // eval
 pneumonia      eval pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the tracheostomy tube remains in
 place.  The asymmetric pulmonary edema appears to be slightly decreased. 
 However, there is a more coalescent area of opacification at the right base. 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 seriously considered.
 Retrocardiac opacification with poor definition of the hemidiaphragm is
 consistent with volume loss in the left lower lobe.
