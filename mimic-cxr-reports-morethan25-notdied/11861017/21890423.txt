                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ventilator dependent respiratory failure  //
 f/u pleural effusions and pulmonary congestion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 04:28
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lordotic positioning.  The patient's tracheostomy is excluded from this film.
 
 As before, the patient is status post sternotomy.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is similar, allowing for differences in positioning.  There has
 been interval improvement in the retrocardiac opacity and in the right base
 atelectasis.  Mild vascular plethora also appears  improved.  Small bilateral
 effusions are again noted, slightly smaller.
