 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison with chest radiographs from ___, small right
 pleural effusion persists.  Retrocardiac opacity has improved, with better
 visualization of the left hemidiaphragm.  Right perihilar and basilar
 opacities persist, likely reflecting combination of atelectasis, aspiration or
 infection.  No appreciable effusion on the left.  No central vascular
 congestion or overt pulmonary edema.  Top-normal heart size is stable. 
 Tracheostomy tube in standard placement, unchanged.
