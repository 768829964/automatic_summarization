                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 12:27 A.M. 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with temperature, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 619.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 12:27 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the proximal SVC.  There is a
 streaky linear opacity at the left base, which may represent an area of
 atelectasis or scarring, although an early infectious process could have this
 appearance and therefore followup imaging would be advised.  The remaining
 lungs are grossly clear.  Several catheters are seen overlying the upper
 abdomen.  No pneumothorax.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No large
 effusions.
