                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ F  HLD induced necrotizing pancreatitis s/p  mult debridements
 c/b colonic perfs and high output EC fistula, mult infections now s/p EC
 fistula takedown, GJ, cholecystojejunostomy, component sep/panniculectomy  //
 PNA? interval changes?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube terminates at the level of the clavicles.  A right subclavian
 central venous catheter terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction. A
 nasogastric tube enters the stomach, distal tip not visualized. There is no
 pneumothorax. Lung volumes are low. Small layering left pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  A right basilar airspace opacity with air bronchograms is more
 prominent today. A left basilar retrocardiac airspace opacity has slightly
 improved following partial re-expansion of the left lower lobe.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Evolving bibasilar pneumonia, right greater than left, after partial
 re-expansion of the left lower lobe.
 Stable small layering left pleural effusion.
 Lines and tubes in satisfactory position.
