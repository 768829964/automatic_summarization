 HISTORY:  Primary sclerosing cholangitis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Reference chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The right subclavian central venous catheter tip terminates in the proximal
 right atrium.  Lung volumes are low.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged, with the heart size within normal limits.  There is
 persistent elevation of right hemidiaphragm with adjacent right basilar
 atelectasis.  No new areas of focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Residual barium oral contrast material is noted in the left colon.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No radiographic evidence for pneumonia.
