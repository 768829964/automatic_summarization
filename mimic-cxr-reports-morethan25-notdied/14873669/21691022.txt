                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate for pneumonia or effusion.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest was obtained with
 comparison to the examination performed one day previously.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right-sided IJ central venous catheter is again seen, with the tip in the
 lower SVC, just at or above the caval-atrial junction.  There has been
 interval removal of left-sided subclavian central venous catheter.
 
 The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated, similar to the prior examination. 
 There is persistence of retrocardiac opacity on the left, which may again be
 related to low lung volumes, although the possibility of an effusion remains
 present.  No new focal pulmonary opacities, or evidence of pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Unchanged examination, status post removal of left-sided subclavian central
 venous catheter.
