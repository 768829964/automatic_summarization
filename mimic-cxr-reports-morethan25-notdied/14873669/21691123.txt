                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST ON ___ AT 12:14 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recent history of sepsis, now with
 fevers, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 19:56.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film on ___ at 12:14 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The right hemidiaphragm remains elevated.  There are patchy predominantly
 linear and streaky opacities at both bases, likely reflecting atelectasis.  No
 focal airspace consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia.  No pneumothorax. 
 A left subclavian PICC line tip terminates in the distal SVC.  Overall,
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  No pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions.
