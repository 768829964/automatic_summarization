                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with pancreatitis and respiratory failure. 
 Evaluate ETT position and for infection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP radiograph from ___ and multiple prior
 radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube is 3.6 cm from the carina.  NG tube can be followed to the
 edge of the film, likely below the diaphragm.  Lung volumes remain very low
 and layering large bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  Linear opacities
 are seen in the right middle lobe, which may represent atelectasis or
 thickening of the fissure.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Right
 IJ triple-lumen catheter ends in the right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET tube 3.6 cm from the carina.  Low lung volumes and large
 layering bilateral pleural effusions.
