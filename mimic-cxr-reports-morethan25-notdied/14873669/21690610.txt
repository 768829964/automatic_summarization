                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pancreatitis, worsening oxygenation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are in unchanged position.  The lung volumes remain low, relatively
 extensive left pleural effusion with associated left basal atelectasis is
 constant.  Also constant is a plate-like atelectasis at the right lung base. 
 There is no evidence of radiographic worsening, notably no evidence of focal
 parenchymal opacities that have newly occurred.  No pneumothorax.
