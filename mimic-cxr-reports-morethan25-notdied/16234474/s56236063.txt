                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F intubated  // tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 2.5 cm above the level of the
 carina.  Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, out of the field of view. 
 There are low lung volumes.  Bilateral perihilar opacities suggest mild
 pulmonary edema.  Left base opacity may be due to pleural effusion and
 atelectasis, underlying aspiration not excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.
