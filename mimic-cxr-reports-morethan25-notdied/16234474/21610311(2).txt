                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with an intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage,
 now with respiratory failure and concern for pneumonia.  Evaluate for interval
 change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A nasogastric tube is in place with the distal tip not visualized.  The
 endotracheal tube terminates 2.7 cm above the carina.  A right-sided internal
 jugular line is in unchanged position.  The cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Vascular is congestion is slightly improved on the right and
 slightly more prominent on the left.  There has been slight interval increase
 in the small left pleural effusion.  New obscuration of the left heart border
 suggests interval increase in basilar atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal increase in small left pleural effusion and left basilar atelectasis.
