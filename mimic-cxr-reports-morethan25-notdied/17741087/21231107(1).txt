                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:21 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with increasing fatigue on ventilator and
 increasing sputum.  Question change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Lung volumes are larger today than at 5:30 a.m. on ___, and small left
 pleural effusion has decreased.  Lower lungs are generally more dense than the
 upper lungs, which is largely a function of dependent vascular engorgement or
 microatelectasis.  Left lower lobe is not as opacified today as it was on
 ___, when the patient was in mild pulmonary edema, since resolved. 
 Heart is normal size, and the engorgement of mediastinal and pulmonary vessels
 has improved.
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube could be as close as 15 mm to the carina. 
 Withdrawal of 2 cm should be considered to avoid inadvertent unilateral
 intubation when the chin and neck are in neutral or flexion.  Upper enteric
 feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Left PIC line tip
 projects over the upper SVC.  No pneumothorax.
