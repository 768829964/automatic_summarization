                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Allowing for differences in positioning, cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by minimal
 interstitial edema.  Small-to-moderate pleural effusions are again
 demonstrated, with apparent interval improvement on the right although
 positional differences limit comparison.  Adjacent retrocardiac opacities
 probably represent atelectasis although infectious consolidation is possible
 in the appropriate clinical setting.
