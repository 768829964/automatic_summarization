                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:07
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumonia, check evolution.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study ___ at 5:26.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 5:07 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The endotracheal tube, feeding tube and left subclavian PICC line are
 unchanged in position.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable. 
 There is likely a layering left effusion with associated retrocardiac airspace
 consolidation most likely representing partial lower lobe atelectasis given
 the effusion, although an infectious process cannot be entirely excluded. 
 There is crowding of the vasculature with no evidence of pulmonary edema.  No
 pleural effusions.  Overall, the appearance is not significantly changed since
 ___.
