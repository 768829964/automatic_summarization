                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, to assess for NG placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the nasogastric tube now
 extends well into the stomach before crossing the lower margin of the image. 
 There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Bibasilar opacifications are consistent with layering
 effusions and compressive atelectasis.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
