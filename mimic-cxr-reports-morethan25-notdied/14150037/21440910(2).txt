                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p LVAD  // eval pna      eval pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Moderately severe pulmonary edema, more pronounced in the left lung appears
 slightly more dense today, but that may be due to a decrease in lung volumes
 with less positive pressure ventilator support rather than real worsening of
 edema.  Severe cardiomegaly is stable.
 
 Cardiopulmonary support devices including left ventricular assist device are
 in standard placements.  Pleural effusion is presumed, but not large.  No
 pneumothorax.
