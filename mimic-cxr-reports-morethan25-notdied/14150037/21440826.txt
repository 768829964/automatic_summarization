                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with as above  // s/p LVAD placement r/o
 effusion/infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, widespread airspace opacities
 involving the left lung to a greater degree than the right have worsened in
 the interval and most likely represent pulmonary edema.  Differential
 diagnosis includes pulmonary hemorrhage and a widespread infection.  Small
 right pleural effusion is new and a moderate left pleural effusion has
 apparently increased in size.  No other relevant change.
