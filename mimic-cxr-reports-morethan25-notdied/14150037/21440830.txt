 WET READ: ___ ___ 6:26 PM
  Compared with the study from the prior day, no significant change in the
  moderate pulmonary edema, moderate to severe cardiomegaly, and a likely small
  left pleural effusion.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  No change the
  positioning of multiple support lines and tubes, including the LVAD.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p LVAD  // eval for effusion      eval for
 effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Severe cardiac enlargement has improved minimally.  Moderate edema in the
 right lung is stable and there has been no change in the more densely
 consolidated left lung.  Pleural effusions are presumed, but not large. 
 Upright and/or lateral projections would be necessary to assess the volume of
 pleural fluid and the presence of atelectasis, which could be particularly
 severe in the left lower lobe.
 
 Cardiopulmonary support devices are unchanged in standard positions.  No
 pneumothorax.
