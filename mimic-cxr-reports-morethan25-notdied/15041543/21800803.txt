                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of confusion, right
 lower quadrant pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Slightly
 streaky opacity at the right lung base may be due to atelectasis, although an
 early consolidation is not excluded.  No focal consolidation is seen in the
 left.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  VP shunt is noted and partially
 imaged, coursing over the left hemithorax into the right upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Streaky right base opacity may represent atelectasis, although
 infectious process is not excluded in the appropriate clinical setting.
