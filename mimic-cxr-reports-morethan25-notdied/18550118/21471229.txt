                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change. Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  Relatively extensive left
 retrocardiac atelectasis.  Unchanged minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic sinus, potentially caused by a small pleural effusion.  The
 endotracheal tube is in unchanged position.  Unchanged position of the
 nasogastric tube.  No pneumothorax.
