                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Status epilepticus.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 ET tube is identified portably about 2 cm above the carina in an unchanged
 position.  NG tube coursing throughout the mediastinum and terminates in the
 expected location of the stomach, though its tip is not seen.  A left-sided
 central line remains kinked with its tip remains in the brachiocephalic vein
 junction.
 
 There are worsening bibasilar opacities likely reflecting predominantly fluid
 with associated atelectasis in the left base and small effusions.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Stable, essential change from prior radiograph, although there
 may be minimal worsening of fluid overload and effusions in the lung bases. 
 Certainly when compared to the radiographs dated ___ at 05:35, there
 is significant improvement in the left lung.
