 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:25 PM
  Little change in comparison to the prior study from the same day with
  bilateral silhouetting of the hemidiaphragms, likely due to  large left and
  moderate right pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. Overlying
  pneumonia at the bases must be excluded clinically. There is continued
  prominence of the pulmonary vasculature consistent with mild to moderate
  increase in central venous pressure. ET tube appears in mid trachea.
