                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post intubation bronch, evaluate interval change.
 
 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 An ET tube is present, the tip lies approximately 16 mm above the carina.  An
 NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm off film.  There is a
 possible second tube lying adjacent to the NG tube, not well demonstrated on
 these views.
 A right IJ central line is present -- given the degree of mediastinal
 rotation, its extent is difficult to determine.
 
 Increased retrocardiac density and also vascular crowding at the right lung
 base with minimal right costophrenic angle blunting are unchanged.
