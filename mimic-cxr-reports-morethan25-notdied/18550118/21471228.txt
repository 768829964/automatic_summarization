                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates about 2 cm above the carina. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance allowing for slight
 differences in degree of patient rotation.  Worsening opacity at the right
 lung base may reflect layering pleural effusion on this semi-upright
 radiograph, but co-existing atelectasis or consolidation is possible. 
 Worsening left retrocardiac atelectasis and persistent small left pleural
 effusion.
