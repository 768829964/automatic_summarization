                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Stroke, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little interval
 change.  Again there is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with pulmonary
 vascular congestion and poor definition of the hemidiaphragms consistent with
 small effusions and basilar atelectasis.  Retrocardiac volume loss is again
 seen.
 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in position.  Lung volumes remain relatively low.
