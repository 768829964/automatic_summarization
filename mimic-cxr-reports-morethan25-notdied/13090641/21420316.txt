                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  MVC, polytrauma and neurogenic shock secondary to T3 spinal
 cord injury.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, CT, ___.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is in the standard position.  Large left pleural effusion
 with large atelectasis, almost collapse of the left lower lobe are unchanged. 
 Right lower lobe atelectasis and right pleural effusion have minimally
 improved.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  The right upper lung is
 clear.  Patient has known multiple rib and vertebral fractures.  Left PICC tip
 is at the lower SVC.
