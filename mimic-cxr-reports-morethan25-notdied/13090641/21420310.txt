                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  T3 transection with chest and purulent secretions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Continued bibasilar opacifications
 consistent with pleural effusion and compressive atelectasis, though a
 superimposed pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  There is also evidence of elevated pulmonary venous pressure though
 the cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.
 
 No substantial pneumothorax.
