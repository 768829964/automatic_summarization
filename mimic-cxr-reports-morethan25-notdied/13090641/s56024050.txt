                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 23:10
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with T3 transection, new fever and check
 placement of ET tube and OG tube.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study of ___ at 15:44.
 
 A portable supine chest film ___ at 23:10 is submitted.  The left
 costophrenic angle and lateral chest is not entirely included on the study.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Study is somewhat limited due to overlying board artifact. Endotracheal
 tube has its tip approximately 4.5 cm above the carina.  There continues to be
 a nasogastric tube coursing below the diaphragm; however, the side port
 remains near the gastroesophageal junction and therefore advancement continues
 to be advised.  A portion of the left chest tube is again seen with the tip
 near the left apex.  No large pneumothorax is seen, although the sensitivity
 to detect a pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.   Given patient
 positioning on the current examination, the previously described rib fractures
 are not as well seen.  Perihilar vessels are somewhat prominent and there is a
 suggestion of pulmonary venous hypertension with no overt pulmonary failure. 
 More focal patchy opacity at the left base may reflect an area of atelectasis,
 pneumonia or aspiration.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Improved aeration
 at the right base.
