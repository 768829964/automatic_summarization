                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Polytrauma, post left chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso available from ___ and radiograph from ___, at 12:36 a.m.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 A left thoracostomy tube is unchanged in position.  Since ___:36 a.m.
 examination, there has been interval restoration of the left diaphragmatic
 border, compatible with resolved pneumothorax.  No residual pneumothorax is
 seen.  Bilateral scapular fractures and multiple rib fractures are better
 appreciated on the CT examination from ___.  The endotracheal tube
 terminates 7.4 cm above the carina.  A left subclavian catheter terminates
 within the mid SVC.  An orogastric tube extends into the stomach.
 
 Mild bibasilar opacities may reflect mild aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval resoluation of left pneumothorax.  Unchanged position of a left
 thoracostomy tube.
 2.  ET tube terminating 7.4 cm above the carina.
 3.  Bilateral rib and scapular fractures.
 4.  Mild bibasilar opacities, possibly reflecting mild aspiration.
