                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Follow up of the patient with history of
 pneumothorax.
 
 AP chest radiograph
 
 Chest tube is in place with interval resolution of the pneumothorax.  The ET
 tube tip is too proximal, about 10 cm above the carina and should be further
 advanced.  The NG tube tip is in the proximal stomach.  Small amount of right
 pleural effusion cannot be excluded given the interval increase in the
 opacification of the right hemithorax in a diffuse manner.
