 over the mid to low SVC.  No evidence of complications, notably no
 pneumothorax. The patient remains intubated, with the tip of the endotracheal
 tube projecting approximately 3 cm above the carinal. The course and position
 of the nasogastric tube is unchanged.  Lower lung volumes than on the previous
 examination but no evidence of overt pulmonary edema or pneumonia.  Moderate
 atelectasis at the right lung basis.
