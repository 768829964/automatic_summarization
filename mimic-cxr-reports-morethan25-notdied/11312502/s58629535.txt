                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pseudomonas pneumonia, ETT  // Please
 evaluate for tube position, acute change      Please evaluate for tube
 position, acute change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged, with the tip of the endotracheal tube approximately 2.5 cm
 above the carina.  .  There are lower lung volumes that accentuate the
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild indistinctness of pulmonary
 vessels is consistent with elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm again is consistent with pleural fluid
 and volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 Radiographically, it is difficult to exclude the possibility of superimposed
 pneumonia, especially given the low lung volumes and absence of a lateral
 view.
