                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after diuresis.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 5.5 cm above the carina.  The right subclavian line tip is
 at the level of mid SVC.  The pacemaker leads are in unchanged position.  As
 compared to prior study, there is minimal interval improvement in pulmonary
 edema, currently mild.  Bibasal consolidations and bilateral pleural effusions
 which are most likely unrelated to pulmonary edema are unchanged.  The left
 chest tube is in place.  No interval development of pneumothorax has been
 demonstrated.
