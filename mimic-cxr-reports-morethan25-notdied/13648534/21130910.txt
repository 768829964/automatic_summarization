                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient status post left-sided chest tube
 removal with history of motor vehicle collision, evaluate for re-accumulation
 of pneumothorax status post left chest tube removal.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made to the next preceding similar
 examination obtained seven hours earlier during the same day.  On the present
 portable examination, the patient is moderately turned towards the right
 resulting in slightly different presentation of pacer, endovascular electrodes
 and right-sided subclavian central venous line.  Position, however, is grossly
 unchanged and the same holds for the ETT seen to terminate some 5 cm above the
 level of the carina.  Remarkable is that the patient has three electrodes
 apparently on biventricular pacing system.  Pulmonary congestive vascular
 pattern has not changed during the interval.  There is no evidence of central
 pulmonary edema presently.  The basal densities have somewhat shifted and are
 more prominent on the right base whereas the left lung base clearly identifies
 the normal appearing contour of the diaphragm.  This can be explained by
 patient's tilted position towards the right with corresponding shift of small
 to moderate bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change short of those related to
 patient's postural alterations.  Again, no pneumothorax is present.
