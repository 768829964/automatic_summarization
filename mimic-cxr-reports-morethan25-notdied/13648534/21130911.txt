 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post intubation and orthopedic surgery.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates further interval
 improvement in bibasilar atelectasis, with probable small residual pleural
 effusion though this also is improved.  There is no focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  The cardiac silhouette and mediastinal contours are unchanged. 
 The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  
 
 An endotracheal tube, NG tube, and left chest biventricular AICD device are
 unchanged, and in standard position.  A right subclavian catheter tip projects
 over the lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Standard positioning of support devices and tubes.
 
 2.  Further interval improvement in bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
