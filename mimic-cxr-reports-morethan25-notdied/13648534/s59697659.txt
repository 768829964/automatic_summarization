                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ years old male patient with left-sided chest tube to
 waterseal.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made to the next preceding similar study
 obtained 10 hours earlier during the same day.  Previously described permanent
 pacer, ICD electrodes, and right-sided subclavian approach central venous line
 are unchanged.  Multiple tortuous wires are overlying the lower chest
 bilaterally.  The patient remains intubated, the ETT in unchanged position
 terminating some 4 cm above the level of the carina.  No pneumothorax has
 developed.  The left-sided chest tube remains in unchanged position,
 terminating in the apical left-sided chest area at the level of the top of the
 aortic arch.  The left-sided lower lateral pleural sinus appears quite free
 from any fluid accumulation.  The previously described plate atelectasis on
 the left mid lung field persists but has not increased.  Right-sided pleural
 densities are rather unchanged, but no evidence of new pulmonary
 abnormalities.
