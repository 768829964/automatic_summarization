                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Intubated, assess position of ET tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  Supine portable AP view of the chest was provided.  The
 endotracheal tube is seen with its tip residing 3.7 cm above the carina.  The
 NG tube is seen with its tip in the left upper abdomen.  A left chest tube is
 in place.  Subcutaneous emphysema is noted along the left base of neck and
 chest wall.  Subtle air lucency adjacent to the aortic knob is compatible with
 pneumomediastinum.  Lower lobe consolidation is evidenced by retrocardiac
 consolidation containing a single air bronchogram.  No discernable
 pneumothorax is seen.  No definitive rib fracture is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube and orogastric tubes appear positioned
 appropriately.  Findings of pneumomediastinum and left lower lobe
 consolidation as well as subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall are better
 assessed on the subsequent CT performed 40 minutes later.
