                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with recent seizures, intubated for
 airway protection, spiked fever overnight to 100.9, pneumonia?
 
 AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in semi-upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding chest examination of
 ___.
 
 There is a dramatic change in the appearance of the lungs which now
 demonstrate a crowded vasculature with typical perivascular haze and multiple
 peripheral parenchymal patchy densities.  The heart size has not increased
 significantly must be considered within normal limits.  No evidence of pleural
 effusion as the lateral pleural sinuses are free and no pneumothorax is seen
 in the apical area.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The markedly acute interval change with now widespread bilateral
 pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities and perivascular haze raises the
 possibility of gastric fluid aspiration in this patient apparently known for
 frequent seizures.  Previously existing ETT which was close to the carina has
 been removed.
 
 Telephone call was placed to Dr. ___ ___ the case was  discussed.  It was
 recommended to have daily followup examinations until normal lungs status has
 been established again.
