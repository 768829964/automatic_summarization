                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated, confirm endotracheal tube placement.  Transferred from
 outside hospital following seizure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ at 1:13 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube is at the level of the carina.  The enteric
 tube ends inferior to the imaged portion of the study.  There is no focal
 consolidation.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.   The
 cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  There is elevation of the left
 hemidiaphragm, which may be a result of mass effect from beneath the
 diaphragm, possibly an enlarged spleen.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Endotracheal tube ends at the carina.  Recommend repositioning.
 
 2. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 3. Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, which may be a result of mass effect
 from beneath the diaphragm, possibly an enlarged spleen.  Correlate
 clinically.
