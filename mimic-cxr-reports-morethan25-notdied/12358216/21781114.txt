 study of ___.  Markedly increased basal density in the right
 hemithorax is indicative of rapid development of pleural effusion.  No
 significant mediastinal shift noted.  Left side is better aerated and shows a
 plate atelectasis on the base. The pulmonary vasculature does not show any
 marked congestive pattern and the left lateral pleural sinus remains free.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Rapid development of extensive right-sided pleural effusion.  The
