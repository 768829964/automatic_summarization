 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable view of the chest.

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ETT is too high and should be advanced by several cm for more optimal
 positioning.
 2.  Persistent bulbous opacity at the left lung base, which may represent a
 mass or abscess.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Conventional chest radiography or CT is recommended for
