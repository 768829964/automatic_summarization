                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Assessment of PICC line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest shows a right PICC with the tip
 terminating at the low portion of the SVC.  This is unchanged since ___.  The tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  The lung volumes remain
 low. There is some airspace opacity at the right base which may be atelectasis
 but raises the concern for pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Satisfactory positioning of right PICC in the low SVC. Opacity at
 the right lower lung which could be pneumonia or atelectasis.
