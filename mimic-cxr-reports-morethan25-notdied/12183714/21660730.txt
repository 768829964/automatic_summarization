                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ years old man with Gram-positive sepsis, new fever;
 assess for pneumonia or other acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest x-ray shows unchanged right internal
 jugular catheter with tip ending in right atrium.  Lung volume is still low
 with new widespread opacity due to mild vascular congestion and worsening lung
 base consolidation, especially to the right, compatible with pneumonia.  There
 is a new bilateral pleural effusion, larger to the left.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged since ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New bilateral pleural effusion; worsening bibasilar opacities,
 likely due to evolving pneumonia secondary to aspiration.
