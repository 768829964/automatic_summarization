 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with red sputum.  Evaluate possible pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Lung bases are less well aerated today than on ___, whether this is
 pneumonia or atelectasis is radiographically indeterminate.  Small right
 pleural effusion is new and the new elliptical opacity projecting over the
 right lower lung could be fissural pleural collection.  Top normal heart size
 is exaggerated by low lung volumes.  Upper lungs show mild vascular
 engorgement but no pulmonary edema.
 
 Right jugular line ends low in the SVC.  No pneumothorax.
