                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, evaluation for pleural effusions and atelectasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes remain
 low.  Pre-existing parenchymal opacity at the right lung base has increased in
 extent and severity.  There also is associated minimal blunting of the right
 costophrenic sinus, potentially reflecting a small pleural effusion.  No other
 parenchymal opacities.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No
 pulmonary edema.
