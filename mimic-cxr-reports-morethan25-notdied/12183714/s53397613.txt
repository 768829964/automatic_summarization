                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old with fevers and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest.  Left PICC is seen with tip in
 the upper SVC.  Right IJ line tip is likely within the right atrium and should
 be withdrawn for optimal positioning.  Low lung volumes again seen.  Streaky
 bibasilar opacities may be due to atelectasis, although infection is entirely
 possible.  The left basilar opacity on prior has improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with bibasilar opacities, potentially
 atelectasis although infection is also possible.  Right IJ line with tip in
 the right atrium and should be withdrawn.  No pneumothorax.
