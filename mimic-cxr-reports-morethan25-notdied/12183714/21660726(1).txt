                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Fevers, positive blood cultures. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right PICC tip terminates in the mid SVC.  Lung volumes are low.  The heart
 size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  Patchy
 linear opacities are noted in both lung bases, most likely reflective of
 atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  There are no acute
 osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Probable bibasilar atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes.  Please
 note that aspiration or infection cannot be completely excluded.  Consider
 followup PA and lateral views of the chest when the patient is able to take a
 deeper inspiration.
