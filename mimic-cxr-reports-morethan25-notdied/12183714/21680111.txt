                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ETT  // interval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip terminates 4 cm above the level of
 the carina.  This is unchanged compared to the prior study.  A left-sided PICC
 is in-situ, the tip terminates in the mid SVC.  A right internal jugular
 catheter is in-situ, also terminating in the mid SVC.  A nasogastric tube is
 in-situ, the tip is not visualized but the side port is below the left
 hemidiaphragm.  Increased opacity at the left lung base with partial
 silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm likely due to a atelectasis but
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded.  No definite effusion seen. 
 Catheter tubing projects over the upper abdomen, this is not clearly localized
 on the current study but given the course of the tubing likely resides on the
 patient's skin.
