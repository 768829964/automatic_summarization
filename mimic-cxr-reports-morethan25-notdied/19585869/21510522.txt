                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulm edema  // ?Interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 05:08
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The carina is not well visualized.  However, the ET tube tip probably lies
 approximately 4.0 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip is present, tip extending
 beneath diaphragm, off film.  Right IJ central line tip overlies the upper
 right atrium.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged, allowing for considerable
 technical difference.  Again seen is upper zone redistribution mild vascular
 plethora, overall similar to the prior study.  There is increased retrocardiac
 density with obscuration left hemidiaphragm, which may be slightly worse. 
 Clips again noted in the region of the GE junction.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Possible slight worsening of retrocardiac opacity.
 
 CHF findings are similar to the prior study.
 
 Right subclavian central line tip overlies right atrium.
