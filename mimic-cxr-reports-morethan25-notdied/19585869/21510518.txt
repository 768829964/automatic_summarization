                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with desaturation  // pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of a right PICC line, projecting over the superior
 cavoatrial junction.
 
 Interval increase in the pulmonary vascular congestion and bilateral diffuse
 patchy airspace opacities consistent with pulmonary edema.  A retrocardiac
 opacity is again present and likely reflective of atelectasis.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions are suspected.  No pneumothorax identified.
 
 The size the cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased pulmonary edema.
 
 The tip of the right PICC line projects over the cavoatrial junction.
