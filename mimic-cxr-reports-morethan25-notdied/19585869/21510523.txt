                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SDH  // interval changes
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 536
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study and allowing for significant differences in
 positioning, degree of vascular plethora may be slightly increased.  There is
 also slight blurring due to respiratory motion.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is again seen. The right
 hemidiaphragm is much less well delineated --___ could be an artifact of
 positioning, but suggests the presence of collapse and/or consolidation at the
 right lung base.  No  gross pleural effusion, though small effusions would be
 difficult to exclude.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is probably unchanged.  Clips again noted in
 the  the region of the GE junction.
 
 ET tube tip lies 3.8 cm above the carina.  Right IJ central line lies near the
 cavoatrial junction, unchanged.  NG type tube extends beneath the diaphragm to
 overlie the proximal stomach.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable slight interval increase in degree of CHF findings.
 
 Persistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 New poor visualization of the right hemidiaphragm raises the possibility of
 right base collapse and/or consolidation, this appearance could be accentuated
 by differences in The patient position.  .
