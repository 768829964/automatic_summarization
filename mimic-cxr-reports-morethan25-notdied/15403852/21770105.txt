  Lung volumes are low.  A right central venous line ends in the low SVC or
  right atrium.  A left PICC ends in the mid SVC.  A tracheostomy tube projects
  over the trachea.  Patient is status post aortic valve replacement with median
  sternotomy with wires intact.  Left perihilar consolidation is unchanged.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man  // eval for pneumonia      eval for pneumonia
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Considerable consolidation persists in the left lung which despite variations
 in pulmonary edema in the right lung, still mild, has been more severely
 consolidated throughout.  This could be pneumonia or atelectasis.  Severe
 cardiomegaly stable.  Pleural effusion is presumed, could be moderate on the
 left, minimal on the right.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Tracheostomy tube midline.  Left PIC line ends in the low SVC.  Dual channel
 right jugular line ends low in the right atrium.
