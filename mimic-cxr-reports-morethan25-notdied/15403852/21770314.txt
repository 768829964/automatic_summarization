                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever  // fever
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Dialysis catheter and tracheostomy
 tube again noted.  Lung volumes are low limiting assessment.  There are small
 bilateral effusions with bibasilar opacities likely representing atelectasis. 
 Mild edema is likely present.  There is no pneumothorax.  Overall
 cardiomediastinal silhouette appears grossly stable.  The imaged bony
 structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings as above raise concern for effusions, basilar atelectasis and mild
 edema.  Difficult to exclude an early lung base pneumonia.
