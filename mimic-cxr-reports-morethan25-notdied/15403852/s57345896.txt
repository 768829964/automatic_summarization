                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with AMS  // eval for ICH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low lung volumes are seen.  There is dense retrocardiac opacity asymmetric
 when compared to the right.  Tracheostomy tube is in place.  Right-sided
 central venous catheter tip projects over the lower right atrium.  Cardiac
 size is difficult to assess given low lung volumes and left basilar opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with crowding of the bronchovascular structures with
 superimposed left basilar opacity which could represent a combination of
 effusion, consolidation or atelectasis.
