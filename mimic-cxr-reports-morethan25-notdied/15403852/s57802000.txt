                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with as above  // s/p ETT reposition check
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable, semi upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ETT tip projects approximately 3.5 cm from the carina.  Enteric tube tip and
 side-port traverses the diaphragm into the left upper quadrant, tips not seen.
 A right IJ approach Swan-Ganz catheter tip projects within the mediastinal
 contours, unchanged.  Lung volumes remain low with bronchovascular crowding. 
 Retrocardiac opacity and left lower lobe opacity may reflect combination
 atelectasis and possible small left pleural effusion.  Asymmetric central
 opacity with air bronchograms, greater on the left, may reflect component of
 asymmetric edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ETT tip projects approximately 3.5 cm from the carina.
 2.  Persistent low lung volumes, atelectasis, and edema.
