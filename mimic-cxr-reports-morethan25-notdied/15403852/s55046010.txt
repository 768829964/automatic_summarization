                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for pneumonia, edema, atelectasis, pulmonary embolism in
 a patient with fever, tachypnea, tachycardia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph demonstrates intact sternal wires, a
 valvular prosthesis, tracheostomy tube terminating in the upper trachea, and
 right subclavian central catheter terminating in the right atrium, all
 unchanged. There are low lung volumes resulting in exaggeration of the cardiac
 silhouette and bronchovascular crowding. Even allowing for this, there is at
 least mild to moderate cardiomegaly. Mild pulmonary edema is improved compared
 to chest radiograph from the day prior. Retrocardiac opacity may be due to
 left lower lobe volume loss, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
 This is similar in appearance. Likely small left pleural effusion. No
 appreciable pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Improved pulmonary edema, now mild. Unchanged likely small left pleural
 effusion.
 2. Low lung volumes. Retrocardiac opacity which is likely due to left lower
 lobe volume loss, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded in the absence
 of a lateral view, as before.
