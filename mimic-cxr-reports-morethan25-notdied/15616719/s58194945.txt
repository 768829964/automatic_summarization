                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ETT replacement  // ETT replaced, OG tube
 placement
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ET tube lies approximately 4.1 cm above the carina, at the level of the
 inferior edge of the clavicular heads.  The OG tube extends beneath the
 diaphragm, off film.
 
 Again seen are hazy bibasilar opacities.  On the right, the right
 hemidiaphragm itself is now visible, although there is likely some layering
 fluid.  There is continued retrocardiac opacity with obscuration left
 hemidiaphragm and probable layering left pleural effusion.
 
 Vascular plethora seen in the upper portion of both lungs is compatible with
 CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The ET-tube appears to have been advanced slightly, based on its relation to
 the clavicular heads.  It now measures 4.1 cm above the carina.
 
 The OG tube and its sideport both extend beneath the diaphragm, beyond the
 inferior edge of these images.
 
 Continued cardiomegaly, bibasilar opacities, and CHF, detailed above.
