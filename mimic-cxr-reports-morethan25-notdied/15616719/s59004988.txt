 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the tracheostomy tube and nasogastric
 tube are unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette is more prominent, though much her
 all of this could be due to the AP supine technique.  Minimal indistinctness
 of pulmonary vessels could reflect mild elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure.  Retrocardiac opacification suggests some atelectatic changes.
