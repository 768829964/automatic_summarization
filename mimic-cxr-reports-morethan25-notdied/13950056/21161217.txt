                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Evaluate position of the line that is falling out and follow
 up pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Right peripherally inserted catheter tip has moved now, projects in the mid
 right subclavian vein.  There are lower lung volumes.  Tortuous aorta, widened
 mediastinum and cardiomegaly are stable.  Bibasilar opacities are improved on
 the left and worsened on the right consistent with worsening atelectasis on
 the right.  Small right pleural effusion has decreased.  Vascular congestion
 has improved.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.
