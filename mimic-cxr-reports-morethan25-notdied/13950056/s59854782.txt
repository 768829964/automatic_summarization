                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: The lung volumes are low.  Hazy opacities overly the lower lung
 fields bilaterally possibly representing a combination of effusion and
 consolidation. The cardiomediastinal silhouette and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.  The ET tube terminates 4 cm from the
 carina.  The NG tube is seen below the diaphragm but the tip is beyond the
 imaged field.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Bilateral lower lung hazy opacities possibly combination of pleural
 effusion and consolidation.  Infection cannot be excluded.
 
 2. ET tube terminating 4 cm from the carina.
 
 3. NG tube tip below the diaphragm but beyond the visualized field.
