                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval extubation and removal of nasogastric tube.  Lung volumes
 are low, accentuating cardiac and mediastinal contours.  Even allowing for
 this factor, there has been worsening of asymmetrically distributed bilateral
 diffuse airspace opacities involving the right lung to a greater degree than
 the left.  There remains no evidence of pneumothorax.
