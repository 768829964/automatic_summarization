                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p LVAD  // eval for effusion/ PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Again seen is the LVAD.  Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the right main
 pulmonary artery.  Left IJ line terminates in the mid SVC.  Feeding tube is
 exchanged for the NG tube and terminates either at or distal to the
 gastroduodenal junction.  Interval removal of the ET tube.
 
 Stable cardiomegaly.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged. No pleural
 effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Improving right upper lobe opacification
 compared to CT chest ___.  Given rapid development and improvement of
 the right upper lobe opacification, atelectasis or aspiration is more likely
 than pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Feeding tube terminates at or distal to the gastric duodenal junction.
 
 Improving right upper lobe opacification compared to CT ___ suggests
 atelectasis or aspiration over pneumonia given rapid development and rapid the
 improvement.
