                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with newly placed endotracheal tube.  Evaluate placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube tip terminates 5.5 cm above the carina and should not be
 withdrawn any further.  A right-sided subclavian line tip projects in the low
 SVC.  Bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacities may be due to severe pulmonary
 edema or hemorrhage, in the correct clinical setting.  No pneumothorax. 
 Retrocardiac opacity may also be due to a component of underlying atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  The endotracheal tube tip terminates 5.5 cm above the carina and should
 not be withdrawn any further.
 
 2.  Bilateral diffuse pulmonary opacity may be due to severe pulmonary edema
 or hemorrhage, in the correct setting.  Retrocardiac opacification may also be
 due to a component of underlying atelectasis.
