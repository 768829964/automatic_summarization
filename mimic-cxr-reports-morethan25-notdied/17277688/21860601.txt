 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, obliquity of the patient somewhat
 detracts from the image.  There again is enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 with diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with the clinical
 diagnosis of severe pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac opacification with
 silhouetting hemidiaphragm is consistent with substantial volume loss in the
 left lower lobe.
 The monitoring and support devices are unchanged.
