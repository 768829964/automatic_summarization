                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with LVAD  // r/o hemothorax, hemoptysis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Low bilateral lung volumes.  Persisting pulmonary edema as well as a
 retrocardiac opacity likely reflecting atelectasis.  There are increasing
 patchy opacities in the right lung zone, nonspecific and may reflect either
 pulmonary edema, infection or hemorrhage given the provided clinical history. 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette is enlarged but unchanged.
 
 Partially evaluated left ventricular assist device.  The patient is status
 post median sternotomy.  A left transjugular dialysis catheter tip extends to
 the cavoatrial junction.  The tip of the right PICC line extends into the
 right atrium.  A tracheostomy tube is present.  The feeding tube courses below
 the level the diaphragms but beyond the field of view of this radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low bilateral lung volumes and persisting pulmonary edema.
 
 Increasing opacities in the right lung zone may reflect pulmonary edema,
 infection, or hemorrhage given the provided clinical history.
