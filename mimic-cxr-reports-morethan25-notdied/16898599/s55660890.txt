 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 6:07
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory failure, assess for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison to ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 6:07 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right internal jugular central line and endotracheal tube are unchanged in
 position.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the
 tip not identified.  There continues to be a layering right effusion with
 associated patchy airspace disease, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis.
 Improving aeration at the left lung base.  No definite left pleural effusion
 can be appreciated on the current examination.  There is no evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are unchanged given differences in patient positioning.
