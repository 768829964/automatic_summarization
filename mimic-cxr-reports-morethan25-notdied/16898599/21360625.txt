                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices remain in standard position, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Bilateral heterogeneous lung
 opacities involving the right lung to a greater degree than the left appear
 relatively similar, prior study.  Moderate right pleural effusion appears
 slightly increased in the interval, and there is also apparent development of
 a new small left pleural effusion.
