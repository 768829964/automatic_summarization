                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure with concern for ARDS.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Bilateral heterogeneous opacifications are
 again seen, more prominent on the right.  Some of this probably reflects
 asymmetric pulmonary edema.  There also are layering effusions with
 compressive atelectasis at the bases.  This appears improved from the previous
 study, though some of this may merely reflect differences in patient position.
