                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with resolving aspiration PNA. Slow serous
 drainage from R chest tube.  // eval for consolidation and eval pleural
 effusions     eval for consolidation and eval pleural effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. Diffuse
 bilateral pulmonary opacification is processed.  Right chest tube remains in
 place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Bilateral hazy opacification
 is again consistent with layering pleural effusions and there is evidence for
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure. Considering all the opacification is
 within the lungs, it would be extremely difficult to exclude superimposed
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
