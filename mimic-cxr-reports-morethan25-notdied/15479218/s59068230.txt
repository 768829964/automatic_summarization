                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post tracheostomy. Evaluate tracheostomy location.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 04:44.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior exam, the endotracheal tube has been removed. A new
 tracheostomy tube sits 7.5 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube and right PICC
 are unchanged. The opacity at the right base appears slightly improved since
 the prior exam, while an opacity at the left base appears worse. These changes
 may be due to patient rotation. Small bilateral pleural effusions are not
 significantly changed. There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is poorly evaluated due to patient rotation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New tracheostomy tube, 7.5 cm from the carina.
