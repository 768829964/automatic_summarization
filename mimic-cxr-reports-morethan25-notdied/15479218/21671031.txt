                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with persistent vent dependency, slowly resolving
 effusions, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with direct comparison made to
 study from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Bibasilar opacities are unchanged since prior study. The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is un changed. There is perhaps slight interval improvement in
 bilateral small pleural effusions. There is mild interstitial edema. No
 pneumothorax is identified.
 
 A tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position. A right upper extremity PICC
 terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction. An enteric tube is partially
 visualized with the tip coursing above the field of view of this exam below
 the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Persistent bibasilar opacities which may represent atelectasis versus
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 2. Slight interval improvement in bilateral pleural effusions.  Mild
 interstitial edema.
