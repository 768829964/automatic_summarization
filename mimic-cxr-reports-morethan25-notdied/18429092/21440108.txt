 interval changes      interval changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change. 
 Tracheostomy tube and right subclavian PICC line are unchanged.  Continued low

 opacifications in both lower lungs with poor definition of the hemidiaphragms
 is consistent with a layering pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis,
 worse on the right.  There may be mild elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
