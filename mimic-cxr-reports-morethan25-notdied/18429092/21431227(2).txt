                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p tracheostomy placement today  // Eval for
 trach placement; interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ at 03:23, a tracheostomy tube has been placed in
 standard position with no evidence of pneumomediastinum.  Exam is otherwise
 remarkable for apparent decrease in size of right pleural effusion.  Relative
 hyperlucency of right upper hemi thorax may be accentuated by patient
 rotation.  However, a repeat nonrotated radiograph in a fully upright position
 may be helpful to exclude the possibility of an atypical manifestation of
 pneumothorax if warranted clinically.
