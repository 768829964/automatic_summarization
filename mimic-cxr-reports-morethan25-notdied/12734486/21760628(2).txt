                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of unresponsiveness
 status post emergent intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, terminating approximately
 5.5 cm above the level of the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below
 the level of the diaphragm, inferior aspect not seen, but coursing into the
 expected location of the stomach.  There are likely bilateral pleural
 effusions with overlying atelectasis.  The right hemidiaphragm appears
 elevated.  There are chronic right chest wall deformities.  Slight prominence
 of the hila may be due to pulmonary vascular engorgement.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are otherwise stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes in appropriate position.
 2.  Low lung volumes.  Bilateral pleural effusions with overlying atelectasis;
 the left base retrocardiac consolidation cannot be excluded.  Elevation of the
 right hemidiaphragm.
