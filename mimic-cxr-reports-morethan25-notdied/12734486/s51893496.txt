                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single supine AP portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with new left IJ line status post
 failed subclavian approach.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single supine AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  There is
 interval placement of a left internal jugular central venous catheter,
 terminating in the distal SVC, without evidence of pneumothorax.  Lung volumes
 are low.  Again there are bilateral pleural effusions with overlying
 atelectasis.  Left base retrocardiac opacity may represent combination of
 effusion and atelectasis although underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.
 There is prominence of the hila suggesting pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 Endotracheal and nasogastric tubes remain in same stable position.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of left internal jugular central venous
 catheter, terminating in the distal SVC, without evidence of pneumothorax. 
 The remainder of the examination remains unchanged.
