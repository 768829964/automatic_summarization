 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal radiograph of the torso centered at the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Lateral aspect of the right chest and upper abdomen is excluded from the
 examination.  Esophageal drainage tube passes beyond the pylorus, probably to
 the second portion of the duodenum.  Stomach is nevertheless mildly distended
 with air.
 
 Moderate left lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural effusion are still
 present.  Heart size is normal.  With the chin down, tip of the endotracheal
 tube is still 4 cm from the carina.  Care should be taken that it not be
 withdrawn from that level.  Left internal jugular line still ends in the upper
 SVC.  No substantial pneumothorax is seen in the imaged pleural space.
