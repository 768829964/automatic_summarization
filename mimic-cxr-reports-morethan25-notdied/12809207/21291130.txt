                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated for airway protection  // eval for
 interval change      eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ through
 ___ at 02:12.
 
 ET tube and nasogastric drainage tubes are in standard placements.  Lung
 volumes are lower exaggerating what could be mild edema and reflecting right
 lower lobe atelectasis.  Repeat imaging at greater lung volumes would be more
 reliable for pulmonary assessment and evaluation of at least mild cardiomegaly
 and some mediastinal venous engorgement.  There is no pneumothorax.  Pleural
 effusion is likely but not substantial in volume.
