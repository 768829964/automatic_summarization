                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with increased purulent secretions, low grade
 temp  // pneumonia?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are low inspiratory volumes, similar prior.
 
 A tracheostomy is in place.  A left-sided PICC line tip overlies the mid/
 distal SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to the prior film,  likely
 accentuated due to low lung volumes.  There is upper zone redistribution and
 hazy opacity in the right mid and cardiophrenic zones could represent
 atelectasis.  There is minimal subsegmental atelectasis at the left base.  No
 definite effusion.  Slight elevation of the right hemidiaphragm with respect
 to left.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity in the right cardiophrenic region likely represents
 atelectasis, in the setting of low lung volumes.  An early pneumonic
 infiltrate cannot be entirely excluded.  There is also minimal atelectasis the
 left lung base.  No definite consolidation or gross effusion.
