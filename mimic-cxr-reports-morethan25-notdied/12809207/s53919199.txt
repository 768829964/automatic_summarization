                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with trache, PEG tube with increased secretions
 (looks like formula)  // Aspiration?     Aspiration?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 11:30
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi supine chest radiograph ___ at 23:38 is submitted
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The patient is markedly rotated to the right and the patient's mandible
 obscures the right apex.  A tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory
 position.  A left subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position.  Overall,
 lung volumes remain diminished and the opacity at the right base may have
 slightly improved suggestive of resolving atelectasis.  No evolving airspace
 consolidation is appreciated, although due to patient positioning and
 inspiration, this study is somewhat limited.  If the patient's symptoms
 worsen, followup imaging would be indicated.  No obvious pneumothorax.  No
 pulmonary edema.
