                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with V-fib arrest status post resuscitation,
 subsequent pneumonia and pneumothorax, now with recent repositioning of the
 right chest tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph done earlier today at 8:02 hours.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm above the
 carina.  Allowing for differences in positioning, the right chest tube is not
 significantly changed in position since prior study.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm and out of view. 
 Left upper extremity PICC terminates in the region of the lower SVC.  Mild
 increase in the right pleural effusion and associated right basal atelectasis
 is noted.  Mild pulmonary edema is worse. Bilateral small pleural effusions
 and left basilar atelectasis are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right chest tube in stable position, without right-sided pneumothorax.
 2.  Mild increase in right pleural effusion, right basal atelectasis and mild
 pulmonary edema.
