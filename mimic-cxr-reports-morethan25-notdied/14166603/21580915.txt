                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man, status post V-fib arrest, complicated by VAP and
 pneumothorax.  Assess for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided subclavian catheter has been removed.  Nasogastric tube
 passes into the stomach and out of view.  Right lower lung opacities are
 increased, particularly along the lateral right lower lung, and could reflect
 aspiration or atelectasis.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. 
 Cardiac size and mediastinal contours are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased right lower lung opacities suspicious for recurrent
 aspiration
