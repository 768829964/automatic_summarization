                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cardiac arrest complicated by flail chest
 and pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple recent radiographs and CTs ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable upright chest radiograph was obtained.  In
 comparison to recent chest x-rays, the lungs appear better ventilated on the
 present exam.  Right middle and left upper lobe pneumonia and trace right
 pneumothorax were better assessed on yesterday's chest CT.  No new
 consolidation, effusion or large pneumothorax is present.  A right pleural
 catheter is in stable position.  A left PICC line tip terminates in the low
 SVC.  Stable enteric catheter.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are normal. 
 Known right rib fractures were better seen on CT.
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates at the midclavicular head.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bibasilar component of atelectasis is improving.  Multifocal
 pneumonia is similar.  Trace pneumothorax is not seen.
