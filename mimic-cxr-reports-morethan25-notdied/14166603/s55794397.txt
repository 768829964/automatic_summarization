                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post cardiac arrest with right flail chest
 with a chest tube in place for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned.  A left upper
 extremity PICC tip projects over the lower SVC.  An NG tube is in place, the
 inferior extent is not visualized.  A right chest tube is unchanged in
 appearance.  A small right pleural effusion remains.  No pneumothorax is
 evident.  Right greater than left infrahilar consolidation is improving
 compared with priors, likely reflecting improvement in atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Standard configuration of visualized lines and tubes.  There is no
 appreciable pneumothorax.
 2.  Improving infrahilar atelectasis, right greater than left.
