                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Prolonged intubation, status post V-Fib arrest.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Lines and tubes are in standard
 position.  Right lower lobe opacity has minimally improved.  Minimal
 atelectasis in the left lower lobe has increased.  There is a small right
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
