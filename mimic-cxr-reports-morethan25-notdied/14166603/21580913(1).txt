                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with pneumothorax after
 chest tube removal.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 There is no evidence of pneumothorax after discontinuation of the chest tube. 
 There is increase in opacity in the right lower and mid lung zone that might
 be consistent with diffuse parenchymal process in the right lung, potentially
 pneumonia.  Left lung is clear except for left basal unchanged atelectasis. 
 No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
