                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Check chest tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lower left chest is off the film.  The ET tube is 5.6 cm above
 the carina.  Right-sided chest tube is again visualized.  There is bilateral
 lower lobe volume loss.  Infiltrate in these regions cannot be excluded. 
 There is bilateral patchy alveolar infiltrate and pulmonary vascular
 redistribution suggesting an element of fluid overload.  Compared to the prior
 study, the volume loss in the lower lobes has increased.
