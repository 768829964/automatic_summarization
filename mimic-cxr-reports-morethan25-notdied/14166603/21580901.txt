                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after cardiac arrest,
 intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study obtained on ___ at 12:37 a.m.  AP radiograph
 of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior studies.
 
 Current examination demonstrates ET tube tip located approximately 9 cm above
 the carina, at the level of the clavicular heads.  The PICC line tip is at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Pigtail catheter on the right is in unchanged position. 
 Extensive subcutaneous air collection is noted on the right, grossly unchanged
 since the prior study.  There is slight overall improvement of the right lung
 opacification with unchanged appearance of the left lower lobe atelectasis. 
 There is small-to-moderate right pneumothorax, unchanged since the prior
 study.
