                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with COPD and recent
 esophagectomy and gastrectomy with desaturations.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of low SVC.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unchanged.  Bibasilar atelectasis, left more than right, is
 noted.  Mild vascular engorgement is present.  Overall, no substantial change
 since prior examination is seen, but bibasal pneumonia cannot be excluded,
 especially on the left.
