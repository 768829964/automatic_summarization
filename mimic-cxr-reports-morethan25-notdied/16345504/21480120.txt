                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Tracheostomy, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright view of the chest provided.  Tracheostomy tube
 is seen as well as a Port-A-Cath overlying the right chest wall with catheter
 tip in the region of the low SVC.  Also noted is a left IJ dialysis catheter
 with its tip extending to the cavoatrial junction.  There is chronic elevation
 of the left hemidiaphragm with lower lobe atelectasis and small left pleural
 effusion, not significantly changed from prior exam.  There may be mild
 pulmonary edema/fluid overload.  Heart size cannot be assessed.  Mediastinal
 contour appears stable.  Bony structures appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable left lower lobe atelectasis and effusion with probable
 mild fluid overload/congestion.
