                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 619
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post esophagojejunostomy with
 complicated post-operative course, assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 546.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right internal jugular central
 line are unchanged in position.  A left basilar chest tube remains in place. 
 Lung volumes are low.  Layering bilateral effusions with associated airspace
 opacity likely reflecting compressive atelectasis.  In addition, there is
 increasing indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature and fullness of the
 perihilar vasculature consistent with superimposed mild pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 difficult to assess given the airspace process and patient rotation on the
 current study.
