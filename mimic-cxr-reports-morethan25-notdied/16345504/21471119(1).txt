  Low lung volumes, increased ground-glass opacity in the left lung.  Fluid

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Gastric cancer, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.5 cm above the carina.
 The course of the nasogastric tube and the post-surgical drains are in
 constant position.  There is slightly increasing atelectasis and minimal
 pleural effusion on the left and newly occurred evidence of mild fluid
 overload on the right, accompanied by minimal fluid markings in the minor
 fissure.  The overall appearance of the mediastinum and the heart are
 unchanged.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
