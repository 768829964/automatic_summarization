                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ years old man status post left chest tube removal, assess
 interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___ at 5:46 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS: Right pleural drain, ET and NG tubes are unchanged and in standard
 position.  Left pleural drain has been removed.  Since prior chest x-ray there
 has been interval reduction of lung volume with increased opacity likely due
 to pulmonary edema.  Part of the opacity in the right lung is residual lung
 parenchymal contusion.  There is no left pleural effusion.  Right pleural
 effusion is small.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size is apparently
 enlarged due to reduced lung volume.
