                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after motor vehicle
 collision with prolonged extrication and question is now pneumothorax.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier as well as chest radiograph obtained right after the MVC.
 
 The heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance, demonstrating
 mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly and slight dilatation of the mediastinum. 
 Bilateral consolidations as demonstrated on ___ chest CT can be also
 seen on the current examination and appeared to be grossly unchanged as
 compared to prior study.  The right chest tube is in place.  Small amount of
 pneumothorax is most likely still present.  The left chest tube is in place as
 well.  The ET tube tip is 7.3 cm above the carina.  The left internal jugular
 line tip is at the junction of left brachiocephalic vein and SVC.
