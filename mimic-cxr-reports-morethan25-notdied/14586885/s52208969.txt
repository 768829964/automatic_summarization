                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:31 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after motor vehicle collision with pulmonary
 contusions, and a right chest tube after bronchoscopy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Aeration in the left lung has improved, and the left lung though still low in
 volume is clear of any focal abnormality and pulmonary vascular congestion on
 that side has improved. The right hemidiaphragm is still elevated.  Right
 pleural effusion is small if any with basal pleural tubes still in place. I
 see no pneumothorax.   Severe enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is stable.
 
 Endotracheal tube ends at the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 6.5
 cm above the carina and should be advanced at least 3 cm for better seating. 
 There is also poor definition of the central airways, suggesting retained
 secretions or clots.   Right jugular line ends just above the origin of the
 SVC.
