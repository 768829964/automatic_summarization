                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 There is a new ET tube 5.4 cm above the carina.  There is pulmonary vascular
 redistribution that is worsened in the interval with alveolar infiltrates
 bilaterally and dense retrocardiac opacity that could be due to volume
 loss/infiltrate/effusion.  The heart size is moderately enlarged.  NG tube tip
 is in the stomach.  There is a small right effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. ET tube in good location.
 
 2. Increased CHF.  An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded
