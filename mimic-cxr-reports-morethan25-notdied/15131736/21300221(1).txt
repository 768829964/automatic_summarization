                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  New endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent radiograph of the same

 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of an endotracheal tube, which is
 low lying with tip approximately 1.6 cm above the carina.  An esophageal tube
 is in place coursing inferior to the diaphragm; however, tip out of view of
 the radiograph.  Lung volumes remain low with mild pulmonary edema.  No
 significant pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, however, unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of endotracheal tube with tip low lying,
 approximately 1.6 cm above the carina.  Mild pulmonary edema.  Distal tip of
 esophageal tube not within the field of view of radiograph.
