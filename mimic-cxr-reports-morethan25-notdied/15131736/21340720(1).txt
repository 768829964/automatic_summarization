                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with new endotracheal tube placement.  Evaluate tube
 position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs of ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the earlier study, a new endotracheal tube terminates 4.0 cm
 above the carina.  Lobe lung volumes are re- demonstrated, with cardiomegaly,
 mild to moderate pulmonary edema, and persistent hilar congestion.  No large
 pleural effusions or pneumothorax on this limited scan.  A presumed enteric
 tube courses be low the left hemidiaphragm another view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube tip positioned 4 cm above the carina.  NG tube extends inferiorly, tip
 not seen.  Persistent pulmonary edema.
