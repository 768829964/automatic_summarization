                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with COPD  // Tachypnea in setting of COPD
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral views the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low with secondary crowding of the bronchovascular markings. 
 There is however superimposed pulmonary edema which may have progressed since
 prior although changes could in part be to lower lung volumes.  Enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette is also noted, again not significantly changed.  More
 dense left basilar opacity, particularly on the frontal view could be
 combination of atelectasis noting that infection is difficult to exclude.  .
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema which may have progressed since prior
 although some changes may be accounted for by lower lung volumes on the
 current exam.  Left basilar opacity, potentially atelectasis noting that
 infection would also be possible.
