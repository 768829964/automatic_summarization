                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shortness of breath and low oxygen saturation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. There is mild
 pulmonary edema, perhaps minimally worse compared to the previous exam. Small
 bilateral pleural effusions may be present, and bibasilar opacities likely
 reflect areas of atelectasis. No large pneumothorax is present though
 assessment of the left apex is slightly obscured due to the patient's neck and
 soft tissues projecting over this region. Degenerative changes of the left
 glenohumeral joint are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes. Mild pulmonary edema and probable small bilateral pleural
 effusions with bibasilar atelectasis.
