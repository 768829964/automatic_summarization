                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___F with  hypoxia,dyspnea and cough  // r/o PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Enteric and ET tubes are no longer visualized.  Degree of pulmonary edema
 perhaps minimally less extensive when compared to prior. Cardiomegaly is again
 seen. Retrocardiac region is not well-visualized potentially in part due to
 overlying soft tissues and atelectasis although underlying infection cannot be
 excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema. Retrocardiac opacity potentially in part technical
 although underlying infection can not be excluded. Appearance is similar
 compared to prior. Consider PA and lateral if patient is amenable.
