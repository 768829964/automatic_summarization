                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with COPD, CHF recent pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Exam is limited by patient positioning as well as the patient's chin and neck
 obscuring the lung apices.  Low lung volumes are present.  Heart size is
 moderately enlarged.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted at the aortic
 knob.  Mediastinal contours are unremarkable.  Crowding of bronchovascular
 structures is present with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Small
 left pleural effusion is likely present.  Patchy bibasilar opacities may
 reflect atelectasis.  No large pneumothorax is present.  There are
 hypertrophic changes noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.  Infection at the lung
 bases cannot be excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion and trace left pleural effusion.
