                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and ___; chest CT from
 ___.   
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including stable cardiomegaly.  There is no definite pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Each hilum is mildly prominent, as before.  Prominence of each
 hilum is probably due to mild enlargement of central pulmonary arteries, not
 significantly changed.  The lungs appear clear.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Similar enlargement of central pulmonary arteries, but no
 definite evidence for acute disease.
