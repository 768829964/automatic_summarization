                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath and hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrate low lung volumes.
 When compared to radiograph dated ___, there has been little
 interval change. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours remain unchanged,
 the heart moderately enlarged. Prominent vasculature and prominence of the
 hila is suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. Obscuration of the bilateral
 costophrenic angles is consistent with likely small bilateral pleural
 effusions versus atelectasis. No acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic moderate cardiomegaly and probably pulmonary hypertension, unchanged
 in appearance when compared to prior examination dated ___. No
 overt pulmonary edema or pneumonia.
