                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The heart is moderately enlarged.  The
 aortic knob is calcified.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are relatively
 unchanged, though there is mild pulmonary vascular congestion, which is worse
 compared to the prior study.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 There is minimal patchy opacity in the retrocardiac region likely reflecting
 atelectasis.  No acute osseous abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion, slightly worse than prior.
