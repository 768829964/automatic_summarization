                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with near fall today feeling generally unwell.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ CT chest
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is status post median sternotomy, and mitral and tricuspid valve
 replacements.  Lung volumes are low.  Heart size remains mildly enlarged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Calcified granuloma is seen
 within the right upper lobe, along with multiple right hilar calcified lymph
 nodes compatible with prior granulomatous disease.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is present, with possible mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Minimal atelectasis is seen in the retrocardiac region without
 focal consolidation.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is visualized. 
 Compression deformities of several mid thoracic vertebral bodies appear
 relatively unchanged with associated kyphosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with possible mild pulmonary vascular congestion and
 retrocardiac atelectasis.
