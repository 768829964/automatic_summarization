                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with recent ICU admission for fungemia now presenting from GI
 suite with leukocytosis. Endorses some mild abdominal pain ttp  //
 Intraabdominal process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral, portable upright views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A double-lumen right internal jugular central venous line terminates within
 the right atrium.  A nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach.  There
 has been interval removal of the previous left-sided CVL.
 
 As compared to the prior examination, lung volumes are decreased and there are
 increasing bibasilar opacities which likely reflect atelectasis.  Small right
 and moderate left pleural effusions have decreased in size from prior
 examination.  The upper lung fields are grossly clear.  The heart remains
 mildly enlarged and there is persistent, mild-moderate interstitial pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Low lung volumes and increasing bibasilar airspace opacities, greater on
 the left, which may reflect atelectasis although superimposed infection is
 difficult to exclude.
 2.  Increased, now small right and moderate left pleural effusions.
 3.  Grossly unchanged, mild cardiomegaly and mild-moderate interstitial
 pulmonary edema.
