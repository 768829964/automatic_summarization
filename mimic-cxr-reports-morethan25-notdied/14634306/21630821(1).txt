                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man in septic shock with increasing peak pressures on
 ventilator, concern for mucus plugging.  // evaluate for interval change, any
 worsening consolidation?     evaluate for interval change, any worsening
 consolidation?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  There has been some decrease in the opacification in
 the lower half of the left hemithorax, consistent with re-expansion of some of
 the left lower lobe, presumably from expectoration of a mucous plug. 
 Nevertheless, there is still asymmetric opacification at the left base,
 consistent with volume loss and possible pleural fluid.
 The pulmonary vascularity remains engorged and indistinct, consistent with
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
