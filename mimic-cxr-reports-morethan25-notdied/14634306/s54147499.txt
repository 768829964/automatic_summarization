                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, pna, ___ lbs over dry wt  // ?volume
 overload
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ through
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. There is continued interval
 improvement of the large left upper lobe pneumonia. Increased opacification of
 the left base may represent atelectasis, however pneumonia can be considered
 in the appropriate clinical setting. There is a small right-sided pleural
 effusion. There is no pneumothorax. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged. A left-sided PICC line ends in the distal SVC.  A granuloma in
 the right upper lung is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement of the large left upper lobe pneumonia.  Increased
 opacification left base may represent atelectasis, however pneumonia could be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  No overt pulmonary edema.
