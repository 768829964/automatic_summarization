                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multifocal pneumonia and bilateral pleural
 effusions. Please assess interval change in pleural effusions. Please perform
 in AM.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to ___, there is mild increased pulmonary vasculature
 congestion, with apparent slight increase in bilateral basilar confluent
 opacities.  The heart size is mildly enlarged.  Costophrenic angles are
 blunted bilaterally.  Support lines are unchanged in position.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Worsening vascular congestion accompanied by slight increase in basilar
 predominant lung opacities favoring pulmonary edema although coexisting
 pneumonia is possible in the appropriate clinical setting.
