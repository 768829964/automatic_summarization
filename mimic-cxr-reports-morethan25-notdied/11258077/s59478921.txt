                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right intraparenchymal hemorrhage status post re-intubation for
 respiratory distress.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 5:27 a.m.
 
 FRONTAL SEMI-SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube ends 4.1 cm above
 the carina.  The right PICC ends in the upper SVC.  There has been interval
 removal of the nasoenteric tube.  Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular
 crowding.  Linear atelectasis in the left lower lung is unchanged.  There is
 no focal consolidation, substantial pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes and hilar contours are normal.
