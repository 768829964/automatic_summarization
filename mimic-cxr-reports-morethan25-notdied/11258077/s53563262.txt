                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 1:38 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post trauma, check position of ET
 tube and orogastric tube.
 
 There are no comparison studies.  Please note that comparison to old films can
 be helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet, approximately 6 cm
 above the carina.  No orogastric tube is seen.  Lung volumes are slightly
 diminished and there is streaky linear opacity in the left mid lung, likely
 reflecting subsegmental atelectasis.  No pleural effusions or pulmonary edema.
 Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely within normal limits given
 portable technique.  No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.
