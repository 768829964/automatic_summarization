                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  SAH with progressive infiltrate.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Cardiac silhouette appears slightly more
 prominent, though some of this could be due to slightly lower lung volumes. 
 There is increased indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, suggesting some
 increasing pulmonary venous pressure.  Basilar atelectatic changes are again
 seen.
