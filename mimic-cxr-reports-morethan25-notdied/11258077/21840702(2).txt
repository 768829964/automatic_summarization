                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Evaluate tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ through ___.
 
 FRONTAL UPRIGHT PORTABLE CHEST: The endotracheal tube ends 5.9 cm above the
 carina.  Nasogastric tube extends to the stomach with the tip out of view. 
 Right PICC ends in the upper SVC.  Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular
 crowding.  Mild linear atelectasis in the left lower lung is new, although
 lung volumes are lower than on the prior study.  There is no focal
 consolidation, substantial pleural effusion, or pneumothorax, although the
 left costophrenic sulcus is incompletely imaged.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 silhouettes and hilar contours are stable allowing for patient position.
