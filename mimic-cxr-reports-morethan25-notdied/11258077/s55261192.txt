                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old pedestrian struck by car with intraparenchymal
 hemorrhage.  Patient is intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent
 from ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube and enteric catheter
 are in appropriate and unchanged position.  Lung volumes are low resulting in
 bronchovascular crowding, though no overt interstitial edema is evident. 
 Aeration of the left lung base has improved.  Mild basilar atelectasis likely
 persists.  There is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within
 normal limits and unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Standard position of support devices.
 2.  Improved aeration of the left lower lobe, though mild probable bibasilar
 atelectasis persists.
