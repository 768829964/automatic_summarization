                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Following removal of a left-sided chest tube, there is no visible
 pneumothorax.  Small left pleural effusion has increased in size.  Moderate
 right pleural effusion is likely unchanged allowing for positional
 differences, and note is also made of atelectasis involving the right middle
 and both lower lobes.
