                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post mitral valve replacement
 with pleural effusions, now evaluate status post left-sided thoracocentesis
 for possible pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding portable chest examination obtained seven hours earlier during
 the same day.  Left-sided thoracocentesis has been performed during the
 interval.  Left-sided pleural effusion has regressed but is not completely
 eliminated.  Some improvement of left-sided pulmonary aeration is noted. 
 There is no evidence of any remaining pneumothorax in the apical area.
