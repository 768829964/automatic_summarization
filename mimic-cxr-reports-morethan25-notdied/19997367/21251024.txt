                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for pneumonia in a patient with cough for one week and
 a past medical history of AML status post-bone marrow transplant.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___ and
 CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were reviewed and compared to the
 prior study.  In the left hemithorax, a dual-chamber pacemaker is seen with
 leads ending in the right atrium and right ventricle.  A right subclavian
 Port-A-Cath with a tip ending in the mid-to-lower superior vena cava is
 unchanged.  Unchanged asymmetrical left apical pleural thickening extends to
 the mediastinal surface and is characterized as post-radiation fibrosis the
 prior CT. Normal heart and lungs with no focal area of consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
