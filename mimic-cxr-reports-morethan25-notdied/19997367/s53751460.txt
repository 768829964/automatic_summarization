 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Thoracocentesis, evaluation of pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The extent of the bilateral pleural effusions, both right and left,
 are not substantially changed as compared to the previous exam.  Effusions are
 bigger on the left and cause moderate bilateral atelectatic changes.  No
 pulmonary edema.  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.  The right internal jugular
 vein catheter has been removed and the right subclavian Port-A-Cath is in
 unchanged position.
