                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG question right pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Again seen is a left apical pneumothorax that has not significantly changed in
 size.  There continues to be alveolar infiltrate throughout the left lung
 which is slightly worse than on the prior study in particular in the left
 upper lung.  There is opacity in the right lower lobe that could be due to
 volume loss or infiltrate.  No right pneumothorax is seen.  The ET tube,
 Swan-Ganz catheter, pacemaker, and right subclavian line, and NG tube are
 unchanged.
