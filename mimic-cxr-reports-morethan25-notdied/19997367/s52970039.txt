                                 FINAL REPORT
 DATE:  ___.
 
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post mitral valve replacement,
 assess effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study of ___.  Status post sternotomy,
 ___ mitral valve prosthesis in place, permanent left-sided pacer with
 dual intracavitary electrode system, all unchanged.  On the right side, the
 evidence of pleural effusion has again decreased slightly in comparison with
 the next preceding study of ___ at which time a mild increase of pleural
 effusion was noted in comparison with an image obtained two days earlier. 
 These variations illustrate difficulties to quantitate pleural effusions on
 single portable chest views.  On the left side, the evidence of pleural
 effusion is more impressive as it obliterates totally the entire left-sided
 diaphragm and the density reaches up to the hilar area and beyond.  Also noted
 is an increased amount of pleural density along the mediastinal structures
 reaching into the left-sided apical area.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Further increasing left-sided pleural effusion likely to
 compromise left side lung function severely.  ___ was paged to
 transmit findings.  He had already observed the findings with massive pleural
 effusion and a pleural tap is planned later this afternoon.
