                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bilateral effusions.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, bilateral decubitus views show
 layering of a large left and moderate right pleural effusion.  The possibility
 of an underlying loculated collection, especially on the left, is impossible
 to exclude on this study.  
 
 Some indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure.
