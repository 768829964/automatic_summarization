                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post recent median sternotomy and mitral
 valve surgery.  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are similar in
 position.  There is no visible pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable allowing for differences in lung volumes.  Small left and moderate
 right pleural effusion are again demonstrated with interval improvement and
 adjacent bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.  Asymmetrical left apical
 thickening with volume loss is likely a sequela of previous radiation therapy.
