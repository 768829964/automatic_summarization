 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH ___
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman who presented with hemoptysis, developing

 Since prior study, there has been no interval change in position of right
 chest wall Port-A-Cath, terminating in the upper right atrium, as well as a
 left chest wall pulse generator, with dual lead pacing wires terminating in
 the right atrium and right ventricle. Median sternotomy wires are intact.  A
 right pleural effusion has slightly increased compared to the prior study,
 along with fluid tracking along the horizontal fissure on the right, and
 subsegmental atelectasis in the right lung base.  Left basilar atelectasis is
 also increased, as has a small left pleural effusion. There is no
 pneumothorax. Biapical pleural thickening is stable. The overall heart size is
 unchanged.
