                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure after cardiac surgery, to assess for
 pneumothorax after thoracentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been a
 thoracentesis on the left with removal of a substantial amount of fluid.  No
 convincing evidence of pneumothorax.  Residual opacification at the right base
 has somewhat decreased.  Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
