                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with empyema  // effusion f.u
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 with resultant bronchovascular crowding.  There is a persistent moderate-sized
 loculated right pleural collection with adjacent atelectasis.  There is stable
 left apical thickening with volume loss. The cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unchanged. Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged. A right-sided
 Port-A-Cath ends at the cavoatrial junction. A dual-chamber pacemaker is again
 seen over the left chest, with appropriate position of the leads in the right
 atrium and ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent moderate size loculated right pleural collection with adjacent
 atelectasis. CT could be considered for additional evaluation.
