                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (AP AND LATERAL)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with cirrhosis, dCHF, dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacer is re- demonstrated with leads terminating in the regions of
 the right atrium and right ventricle. The patient is status post median
 sternotomy and mitral valve replacement. Mild enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is re- demonstrated. Mediastinal contours are similar with
 atherosclerotic calcifications noted at the aortic knob.  Moderate pulmonary
 edema persists.  A more focal opacity is seen in the right lung base,
 potentially atelectasis but infection is not excluded. Small bilateral pleural
 effusions, right greater than left, have slightly increased in size. No
 pneumothorax is present. Multilevel mild degenerative changes are noted in the
 thoracic spine. Clips in the upper abdomen are from prior cholecystectomy. 
 Patient is status post left mastectomy and breast implant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema, similar compared to the previous exam with slight
 increased size of small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.
 More focal right basilar opacity could reflect atelectasis though infection is
 not excluded.
