                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  AML, pleural effusions with hypotension.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Left-sided pacemaker
 device with leads terminating in the right atrium and right right ventricle is
 again noted.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath is present with tip terminating in the
 SVC.  Heart size is borderline enlarged.  Aortic knob is calcified.  There is
 no pulmonary edema demonstrated.  Opacification of the left lower lobe appears
 improved in the interval.  Small bilateral pleural effusions however are new
 compared to the prior exam.  No pneumothorax is demonstrated.  Biapical
 pleural thickening or scarring is present.  Cholecystectomy clips are noted in
 the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 New small bilateral pleural effusions.  Interval improvement in aeration of
 the left lower lobe likely reflecting improving atelectasis.
