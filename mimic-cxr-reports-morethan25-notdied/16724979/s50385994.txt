                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:58
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post tracheobronchoplasty, question pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 18:13.
 
 A single portable AP semi-erect chest film, ___ at 5:58 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The right subclavian PICC line now appears to have its tip in the distal SVC
 near the cavoatrial junction.  Endotracheal tube and right chest tube are
 unchanged in position.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm
 with the tip not identified.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema again noted. 
 No definite pneumothorax is seen, although this is somewhat difficult given
 the positioning of the patient on this study and patient rotation.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.  There is persistent
 patchy opacity at the left base.  No evidence of pulmonary edema or pleural
 effusions.
