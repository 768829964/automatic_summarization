                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST X-RAY.
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with tracheoplasty for tracheobronchomalacia, evaluation
 for change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The tracheostomy is in good position.  The left subclavian line ends in the
 mid superior vena cava.  The cardiac and mediastinal contour are unchanged. 
 There is a right pigtail that projects in the lower peripheral hemithorax. 
 The residual pleural effusion is difficult to assess.  Stability of the
 bilateral moderate ground-glass opacities with cephalization of the pulmonary
 vessels and increased interstitial opacities that are compatible with moderate
 pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 Stability of the moderate pulmonary edema.
