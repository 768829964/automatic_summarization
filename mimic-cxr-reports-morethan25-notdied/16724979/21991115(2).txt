 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Marked subcutaneous emphysema is again seen tracking up the right
 chest wall, bilateral neck, and outlining the pectoral muscle, though it has
 minimally decreased.  Pneumomediastinum is again noted. A small right apical
 pneumothorax persists.  A right chest tube is unchanged in position with its
 tip directed towards the right lung apex.  Bibasilar atelectasis is slightly
 increased from prior.  The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged, the
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  An ET tube and NG tube are unchanged in
 appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right apical pneumothorax; marked subcutaneous emphysema
 and pneumomediastinum are minimally improved.
