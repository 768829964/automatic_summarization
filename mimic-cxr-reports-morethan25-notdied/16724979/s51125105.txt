                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 18:13.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Status post tracheobronchoplasty, evaluate PICC line
 placement.
 
 Comparison to ___ at 15:42.
 
 Portable AP supine chest film ___ at 18:15 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right chest tube with its tip near the right apex.  Right subclavian PICC
 line with its tip in the mid superior vena cava.  Endotracheal tube has its
 tip at the thoracic inlet.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the
 diaphragm with the tip not identified.
 
 2.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema. No obvious large pneumothorax on this
 supine film, although the sensitivity is diminished given supine technique. 
 Patchy opacity at the left base most likely reflects atelectasis, although an
 early pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are stable.
