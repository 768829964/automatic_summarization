                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube position in a patient with hypoxia,
 ventilator-associated pneumonia, tracheobronchoplasty, who recently failed
 extubation.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Series of radiographs dating back to ___, most
 recently from ___ at 5:42 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable AP radiograph of the chest excludes a large portion of
 the left lung.  The endotracheal tube terminates no less than 3.6 cm above the
 carina.  An orogastric tube courses into the stomach and inferiorly beyond the
 field of view.  There is persistent mild cardiomegaly, central venous and
 pulmonary vascular congestion and mild pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax or right-sided pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The endotracheal tube terminates no less than 3.7 cm above the carina.
 2.  Stable decompensated congestive heart failure resulting in mild pulmonary
 edema and central venous engorgement.
