 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Tracheostomy, history of respiratory failure, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the extent of the
 relatively large bilateral pleural effusions is constant.  In addition,
 today's radiograph shows signs suggestive of pulmonary edema, mild-to-moderate
 severity.  Relatively extensive bilateral basal areas of atelectasis persist. 
 Unchanged monitoring and support devices.
