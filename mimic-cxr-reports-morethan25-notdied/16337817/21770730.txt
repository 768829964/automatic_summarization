                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post aortic valve replacement.  Assess
 Dobbhoff tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 There has been interval extubation.  A left internal jugular central venous
 catheter terminates at the brachiocephalic/SVC junction.  A right internal

 There are persistent bibasilar opacities, left greater than right, likely a
 combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema is
 identified.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Coiled Dobhoff feeding tube with the tip at the level of the mid
 esophagus.  Repositioning is recommended.
 
 2.  Standard position of all of the support devices. 
 
 3.  Unchanged bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis and effusion.
 
 Dr. ___ communicated the malposition of the Dobbhoff tube to nurse
