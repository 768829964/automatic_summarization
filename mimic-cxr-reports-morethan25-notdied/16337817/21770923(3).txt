                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with pneumothorax, status post chest
 tube switched to water seal.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest obtained with patient in semi-upright
 position is analyzed in direct comparison with the next preceding similar
 study obtained six hours earlier during the same day.  Tracheostomy cannula
 remains in unchanged position.  The same holds for multiple other devices and
 unchanged position is noted of the CoreValve typical grid structures in the
 left ventricular outflow tract-aortic valve area.  Cardiac contours,
 sternotomy wire, and anterior chest wall stabilization device are unchanged. 
 Left-sided pleural effusion obliterating diaphragmatic contour is unchanged. 
 The degree of pulmonary vascular congestion is as before.  No significant
 remaining pneumothorax can be identified on either side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings during latest examination interval.
