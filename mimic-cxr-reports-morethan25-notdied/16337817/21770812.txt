                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post intubation, check ETT
 position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study obtained 1 hour and 20 minutes earlier.  The patient is intubated, the
 ETT terminating in the trachea some 4 cm above the level of the carina.  As
 before, a tiny right apical pleural separation indicates a residual
 pneumothorax which does not show tension or increase.  Metallic grid
 structures of cor valve prosthesis is noted in place, unchanged in position. 
 Heart size has not increased and the pulmonary vasculature is not congested. 
 Previously identified right subclavian approach central venous line and
 right-sided chest tube with pigtail end configuration and mediastinal drainage
 line advanced from below as before.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Appropriate placement of NGT, unchanged findings in patient who received cor
 valve prosthesis, no pulmonary congestion presently.
