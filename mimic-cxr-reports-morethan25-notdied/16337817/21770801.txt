                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:29 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman after TAVR with an elevated white count.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Opacification at the left lung base, probably due to a combination of pleural
 effusion and atelectasis, shows more volume loss today than yesterday.  There
 is, however, more consolidation at the base of the right lung which raises
 concern for pneumonia.  The upper lungs are clear.  Mild cardiomegaly is
 stable.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are presumed, but no worse. 
 Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view, no longer looped in the
 upper stomach.  Left jugular introducer or dual-channel catheter ends in the
 upper-to-mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
