                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after core valve
 replacement and sternal plating.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The Dobbhoff tube passes below the
 diaphragm most likely terminating at least at the second portion of the
 duodenum.  Right pigtail catheter is in place.  The right internal jugular
 line tip is at the level of low SVC.  The heart size and mediastinum appear to
 be unchanged since the prior study.  Mediastinal drain is in place.  The
 replaced core valve is in place.  There is small right apical pneumothorax,
 unchanged since the prior study from ___ and ___.
 
 Left retrocardiac opacity appears to be unchanged since the most recent
 studies, most likely consistent with a combination of atelectasis and
 effusion.
