                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed six hours earlier.
 
 Small right pneumothorax is stable.  Now small left pneumothorax has
 decreased.  Left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity has increased, consistent
 with increasing atelectasis.  Small left pleural effusion is probably
 unchanged.  Right lower lobe linear atelectasis is stable.  Lines and tubes
 are in unchanged standard position.
