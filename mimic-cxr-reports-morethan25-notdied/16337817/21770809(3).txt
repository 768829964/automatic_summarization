                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post AVR.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 Comparison is made to prior study performed six hours earlier.
 
 Small right apical pneumothorax is unchanged.  Moderate enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is stable.  Small bilateral pleural effusions larger on the
 left side with adjacent atelectasis left greater than right are stable.  Other
 lines and tubes are in unchanged position.
