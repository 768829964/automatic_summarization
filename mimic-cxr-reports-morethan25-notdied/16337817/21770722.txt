                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with aortic valve stenosis, now status
 post core valve placement.  Check position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP chest view obtained with patient in supine position indicates
 that the patient is now intubated, the ETT terminating in the trachea 4 cm
 above the level of the carina.  The typical grid of a core valve can be
 identified in a location indicating aortic valve and proximal aorta.  Heart
 size is not enlarged and there is no evidence of pulmonary congestion.  A
 right internal jugular approach wire is seen terminating in a location,
 indicating the right ventricle.  It is assumed that this is a temporary pacing
 wire.  Electrode wire is overlying the left-sided lower neck region and
 terminates overlying the mediastinal structures.  It is probably external.  An
 NG tube is seen to reach below the diaphragm and is curled up in the stomach. 
 Remarkable is the presence of three circular wires in sternotomy location
 which would indicate that the core valve replacement was combined with a
 partial surgical approach.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Core valve device in appropriate position, partial sternotomy, no
 pulmonary congestion, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax on first postoperative
 examination.
