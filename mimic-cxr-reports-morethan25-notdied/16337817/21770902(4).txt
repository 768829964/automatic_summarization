                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study
 obtained the same day earlier.
 
 The right chest tube is in place.  There is no substantial interval change or
 potentially minimal decrease in the subcutaneous right chest wall air.  There
 is substantially small amount of pneumothorax but it is difficult to assess
 given overlying supporting devices projecting over the right apex.  Right
 pleural effusion is unchanged in appearance, moderate.  Adjacent atelectasis
 is present.
