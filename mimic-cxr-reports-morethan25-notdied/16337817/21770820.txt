                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:05 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with bilateral chest tubes, right-sided to
 waterseal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___, 6:40 p.m.:
 
 Small right pneumothorax, predominantly apical, and small-to-moderate left
 pneumothorax both apicocostal and probably anterior have not changed since
 ___.  Left lower lobe atelectasis has improved.  There is no
 appreciable pleural effusion.  Subcutaneous emphysema has increased in the
 left chest wall, presumably along the course of the pleural drainage catheter
 which ends alongside the mediastinal drain at the level of the clavicles and a
 right pleural tube extending more superiorly.  A drainage tube ends in the
 upper stomach, and a feeding tube passes beyond the drainage tube into the
 distal stomach.  Heart size mildly enlarged, acutely unchanged.
