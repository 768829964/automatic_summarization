                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Removal of chest tube.  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 There is no evident pneumothorax.  Large bilateral pleural effusions with
 associated atelectases have increased on the right.  Cardiac size is obscured
 by the lung abnormalities.  Aortic stent and central catheters are in
 unchanged and standard position.  Right jugular subcutaneous emphysema has
 minimally improved.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.
