 AP CHEST, 8:35 A.M. ON ___ 
 
 HISTORY:  An ___-year-old woman after an AVR.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Small right apical pneumothorax is slightly smaller today at the level of the
 third posterior rib, previously at the level of the third posterior
 interspace.  Left lower lobe collapse and small left pleural effusion are
 stable.  Left apical pneumothorax is tiny, unchanged.  Upper enteric tube
 drainage tube ends in the proximal stomach and a feeding tube passes into the
 duodenum and out of view.  Right pleural pigtail catheter unchanged in
 position laterally at the level of the aortic knob.  Small catheter projecting
 over the right axilla could be a PICC line, and it ends just outside the
 chest.
