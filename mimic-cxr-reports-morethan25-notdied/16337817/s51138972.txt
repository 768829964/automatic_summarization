                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Large amount of blood suctioned from the tracheostomy tube, to
 assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. 
 Monitoring and support devices are again seen.  Large bilateral pleural
 effusions with compressive atelectasis at the bases persist.  There is
 probably some underlying pulmonary vascular congestion.
