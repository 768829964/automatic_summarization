                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with low cardiac output, evaluation for
 pericardial effusion and enlarging silhouette.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs of the chest from ___.  The study is read in conjunction with cardiac CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates interval

 effusion.  There is also persistence of the previously seen left pleural
 effusion.  There is no pulmonary edema or pneumothorax.  The radiograph is
 otherwise unchanged compared to prior study.
 
 CONCLUSION:  Interval widening of the cardiomediastinal silhouette, suspicious

 Persistence of previously seen left pleural effusion.  Otherwise, unchanged
 since prior study.
