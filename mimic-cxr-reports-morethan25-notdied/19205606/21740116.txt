                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Postoperative to assess for pneumo.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ sheath has been
 removed.  There is now a Dobbhoff tube in place with the tip in the body of
 the stomach pointing upward.  Apparent endotracheal tube is very difficult to
 assess on this study.
 
 There is again substantial enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, worse on the right.  Subcutaneous gas is
 decreasing bilaterally.  No definite pneumothorax is appreciated.  Bibasilar
 opacification is consistent with pleural effusion and atelectasis.  The area
 behind the heart cannot be adequately evaluated and there is probably
 substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
