                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube has been advanced, and now terminates
 approximately 3.5 cm above the carina.  Right internal jugular vascular sheath
 appears kinked in the expected location of the skin insertion site.  Recently
 discovered small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax is not clearly visible
 on today's study, but it could be obscured by the presence of worsening
 subcutaneous emphysema in the chest wall.  Interval widening of
 cardiomediastinal contours compared to the previous study, which may be due to
 increasing volume status of the patient in the setting of new pulmonary
 vascular congestion and mild interstitial edema.  Worsening bilateral
 retrocardiac opacities probably represent atelectasis with adjacent small
 pleural effusions.  In addition to chest wall subcutaneous emphysema, note is
 made of a large amount of subcutaneous emphysema in the left cervical and
 supraclavicular regions.
