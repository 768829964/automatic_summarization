                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with repair of aortic dissection, elevated white blood
 count, rule out infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  X-rays from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 4.4 cm above the carina.  The NG tube that was in adequate
 position on yesterday's x-ray now goes down to the proximal stomach and then
 curves back up to the mid esophagus.  Bilateral moderate basilar
 consolidations and pleural effusions are unchanged. Left-sided subclavian line
 ends in upper SVC.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  NG tube is now curling back up to the mid esophagus and has to be
 repositioned.
 2.  Unchanged bibasilar consolidations and pleural effusions.  This is
 probably mainly due to atelectasis; however, superimposed infection or
 aspiration cannot be excluded.
 
 This was discussed with nurse practitioner, ___ at 11:11 a.m.
