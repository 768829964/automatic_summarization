                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubation, hypoxia  // PNA?      PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 12:50 p.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube in standard placement.  Left subclavian line ends at the origin of the
 SVC.  Right internal jugular sheath ends at the junction with the right
 subclavian vein. The right paratracheal mediastinal widening predating the
 insertion of that device, is probably venous engorgement exaggerated in the
 semi supine patient.
 Since earlier in the day large right pleural effusion has increased and
 moderately severe ipsilateral pulmonary edema worsened.  Both are less severe
 in the left hemithorax.  There is no pneumothorax.
