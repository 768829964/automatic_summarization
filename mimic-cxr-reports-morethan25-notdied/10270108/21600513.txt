                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with multifocal pneumonia with recent NG tube
 placement.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.   Please note that the lung
 apices have been excluded from the study.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right central line terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  There
 has been interval placement of an endogastric tube whose side port projects
 over the gastric bubble, well below the GE junction.  The heart size is large,
 but stable compared to prior exams.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 within normal limits.  Again are seen multiple air space opacities, upper and
 lower portions of the right lung, but worsening in the retrocardiac space. 
 Pulmonary edema has worsened.  Blunting of both costophrenic angles suggests
 bilateral pleural effusions, with portions of fluid tracking along the right
 lateral pleural space.  Assessment of pneumothorax is limited by the exclusion
 of the lung apices on this exam.  A single distended loop of bowel is present
 below the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Continued multifocal opacities, worsened in the retrocardiac
 space, fitting with pneumonia; additionally, worsening pulmonary edema;
 uncomplicated appearance of endogastric tube.
