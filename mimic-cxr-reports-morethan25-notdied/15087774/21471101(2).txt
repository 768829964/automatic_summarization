  A series of 4 portable chest radiographs demonstrate a double off tube, a
  final picture demonstrates the tip of the dap up to 5 which projects over the
  left upper quadrant in the anticipated location of the stomach.  A right PICC
  terminates within the upper SVC.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
  stable.
