                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with post intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 7.8 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip terminates in the stomach, however the side port is above the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Heart size is normal.  The aorta appears tortuous.
 Emphysematous changes are noted within the lungs without focal consolidation. 
 Streaky atelectasis or scarring is noted in the lung bases.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is detected.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged. 
 No acute osseous abnormality is clearly visualized.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Standard positioning of the endotracheal tube
 2. Enteric tube tip within the stomach however side port is above the
 gastroesophageal junction and should be advanced by approximately 10 cm for
 optimal positioning.
 3. Emphysema.
