 FINDINGS: Endotracheal tube has been removed in the interim.  The NG tube is
 seen within a markedly distended stomach.
 
 Low lung volumes are low, which results in crowding of the bronchovascular
 structures.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  There is no focal
 airspace consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION: NG-tube within a markedly dilated stomach.
