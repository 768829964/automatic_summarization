                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Cough and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The aorta is
 moderately tortuous and partly calcified, particularly along the arch.  The
 cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  Blunting along the
 left costophrenic sulcus, probably due to scarring, appears unchanged.  It is
 accordingly difficult to exclude a small pleural effusion but pleural
 effusions are doubted.  The lungs appear hyperinflated.  Patchy subpleural
 opacification at each lung apex, more extensive on the right than left,
 appears stable and suggests minor scarring.  Streaky linear opacities in the
 right lung are probably due to atelectasis or scarring.  There is no evidence
 for focal consolidation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
 areas of chronic minor scarring, but no definite evidence for pneumonia.
