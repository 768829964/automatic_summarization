                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Epigastric abdominal pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 2 views were obtained of the chest.  The lungs are hyperexpanded
 with interstitial abnormality suggesting emphysema.  Blunting of the left
 costophrenic angle reflects unchanged localized pleural and parenchymal
 scarring with volume loss.  Biapical scarring is similarly unchanged. There is
 no pneumothorax.  The heart is normal in size with tortuous aortic contour. 
 Mild height loss of the vertebral bodies in the mid thoracic spine is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: Emphysema without acute intrathoracic process.
