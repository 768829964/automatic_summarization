 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, tube has been removed.  The
 radiograph shows unchanged bilateral basal opacities, likely atelectatic in
 origin.  Better than on the previous image, the lateral radiograph today shows
 mild-to-moderate pleural effusions, right more than left.  The heart continues
 to be enlarged and signs of mild fluid overload are present.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.
