 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute shortness of breath, evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Low lung volumes with bilateral pleural effusions and rather
 extensive parenchymal opacities.  The patient is more rotated than on the
 previous image, but the pre-existing left lung opacity appears to have
 minimally decreased in severity and extent.  Unchanged overall appearance of
 the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
