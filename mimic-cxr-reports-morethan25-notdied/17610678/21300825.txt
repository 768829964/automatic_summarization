                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post CABG presenting with productive cough.  Evaluate for
 pneumonia versus effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect AP and lateral chest radiographs.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post CABG and median sternotomy. As compared to prior
 chest radiograph from ___, lung volumes are decreased and there
 is increased moderate size bilateral pleural effusions, right worse than left.
 There is redemonstration of bibasilar opacities which could reflect
 atelectasis, however an underlying infectious process cannot be entirely
 excluded.  There is no pneumothorax There is mild pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiac silhouette appears mildly enlarged.  Aorta is calcified and tortuous.
 Remote left sided rib fractures are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Interval increase in size of moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right
 worse than left in the setting of decreased lung volumes. 
 
 2.  Bibasilar opacities which could reflect atelectasis, however an underlying
 infectious process cannot be entirely excluded.  
 
 3.  Mild pulmonary edema.
