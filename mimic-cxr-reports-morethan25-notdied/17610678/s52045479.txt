                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post fall with injury to the head and generalized
 weakness.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest provided.  Two clips are
 seen projecting over the right upper lung, though these appear to be external
 to the patient as they are not seen on the lateral view.  There is severe
 emphysema with areas of scarring in the lower lungs as well as hyperinflation
 and flattened diaphragms.  Evaluation for subtle nodularity is limited due to
 severe underlying chronic lung disease.  Allowing for this, no large
 consolidation is seen.  The heart and mediastinal contour appears stable.  No
 definite bony abnormalities are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic changes compatible with emphysema without definite
 traumatic injury seen.
