                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with bilateral ankle swelling, history of
 congestive heart failure, and recent pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral chest radiographs were obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The hila are more prominent bilaterally, suggestive of mild central
 vascular congestion.  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax is detected.  Biapical pleural thickening persists.  Blunting of
 the left costophrenic angle appears unchanged.  Heart and mediastinal contours
 are unchanged, with tortuous calcified aorta.  The lungs are hyperinflated,
 which appears similar compared to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild increased prominence of the central pulmonary vasculature
 and persistent lung hyperinflation.
