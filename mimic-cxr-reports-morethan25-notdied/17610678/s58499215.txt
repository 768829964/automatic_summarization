  ET tube in satisfactory position.  NG tube terminates at the level of the GE
  junction and could be advanced 7 cm for optimal positioning.  Lungs are
  hyperexpanded in the patient is rotated.  The previously seen right basilar
  opacity is not as well assessed.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  COPD, STEMI, evaluation for nasogastric tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube is in correct position.  The nasogastric tube
 terminates at the level of the gastroesophageal junction.  For correct
 positioning in the stomach, the device should be advanced by approximately 8
 cm.  Pulmonary overinflation and patient rotation with subsequent asymmetry of
 the pulmonary radiodensity.  The current image shows no evidence for the
 presence of a right basilar opacity.  The aortic balloon pump projects 1 cm
 above the upper aspect of the aortic arch.
