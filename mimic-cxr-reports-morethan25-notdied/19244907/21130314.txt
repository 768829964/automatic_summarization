                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs from ___ and chest CT from ___, both
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has a tracheostomy.  A new PICC line terminates in the lower
 superior vena cava.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours open are
 probably unchanged although the cardiac contour is partly obscured by a new
 moderate left-sided pleural effusion with probable opacification of portions
 of the left lower lobe and lingula.  More superiorly the left lung remains
 clear.  The right lung also remains clear.  There is no evidence for pleural
 effusion on the right side.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New left-sided pleural effusion with opacifications probably attributed
 atelectasis.  Infection does not need to be invoked to explain this appearance
 but is not excluded.
