                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with fever  // eval PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 A tracheostomy tube is in place. Compared with the most recent chest x-ray
 from ___ at 23:23, there is relatively extensive new opacity in
 the left lower zone, with retrocardiac density, obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm and hazy opacity extending along the left lower chest wall.
 There is a very slightly coarsened appearance to the vessels/parenchymal
 markings in the left upper zone, which is new, but no focal consolidation or
 evidence of CHF. The cardiac silhouette is also slightly larger. Aside from
 minimal atelectasis at the right lung base, the right lung and costophrenic
 sulcus are clear.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Prominent new opacity at the left lung base, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation. An element of pleural fluid would be difficult
 to exclude.
