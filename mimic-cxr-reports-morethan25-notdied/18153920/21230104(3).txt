  Little change in comparison to the prior study from the same day with a right
  apical pneumothorax likely persisting. Stable appearance of ET tube in mid
  trachea, enteric tube in stomach, right IJ with tip at superior cavoatrial
  junction, and bilateal chest tube.  On the left, no pneumothorax is currently
  visualized. Moderate air inclusions in the soft tissues bilaterally.
  Nondisplaced fracture of the distal third of the left clavicle is again
  noted.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient struck by car, poor neurologic exam, hemodynamic
 instability require vasopressor support, head trauma, pneumo/hemothorax. 
 Chest tube clamped on left, evaluate for reaccumulation.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube, NG tube, right subclavian central catheter, and bilateral
 chest tubes are in unchanged position.  The small right apical pneumothorax
 has decreased slightly.  There is no significant change in extensive
 subcutaneous emphysema.  Otherwise, no significant change from two hours
 prior.
