                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient with chest tube.
 
 Cardiac size cannot be evaluated due to the rotation of the patient.  ET tube
 is in standard position.  Dobbhoff tube tip is in the stomach.  Right apical
 and left medial chest tubes are in unchanged position.  Very small bilateral
 apical pneumothoraces are unchanged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are
 probably unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient. 
 Mild pulmonary edema is stable.  Biapical and bilateral basal opacities that
 are unchanged and a combination of atelectasis and fluid in the fissure.
