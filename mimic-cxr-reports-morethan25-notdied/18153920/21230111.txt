                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with continued intubation, traumatic brain injury.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 2.2 cm above the carina.  NG tube is in the stomach.  Left-sided
 consolidation has improved but right-sided has worsened.  The overall change
 from day to day is probably due to positioning and not to real change in the
 lung opacities.  Pleural effusions are probably small.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are normal.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Small change from day to day in the lung opacities are probably not
 significant and position dependent.
 2.  Tube and lines are in adequate position.
