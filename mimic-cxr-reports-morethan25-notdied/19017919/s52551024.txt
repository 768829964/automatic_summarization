 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the
 monitoring and support devices.  The hazy opacifications obscuring
 hemidiaphragm are much less prominent.  Although this could represent
 substantial clearing of pleural effusions, it also could be a manifestation of
 a more erect position of the patient.  Mild basilar atelectatic changes,
 especially on the left.
 Otherwise little change.
