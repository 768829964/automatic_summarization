 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with IPH s/p trach/peg. Unable to wean from vent.
 // Interval change      Interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantial improvement in what was very asymmetric pulmonary opacification
 over just 48 hrs suggests this was largely pulmonary edema.  Moderate right
 pleural effusion is smaller and the pulmonary vascular and mediastinal
 engorgement have also improved.  Left PIC line ends in the upper right atrium,
 all approximately 3 cm below the estimated location of the superior cavoatrial
 junction.
