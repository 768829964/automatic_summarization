 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___ common the AL-defined area of
 increased opacification in the right upper zone is not definitely appreciated.
 The lobulated opacification adjacent to the left lateral chest wall consistent
 with pleural fluid, some of which appears to be loculated, is unchanged, as

 effusion with compressive atelectasis is again seen.
 Generalized osteopenia with loss of height of multiple thoracic vertebral
