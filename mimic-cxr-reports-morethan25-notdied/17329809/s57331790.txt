                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with left pleural effusion  // check interval
 change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have increased,
 likely reflecting improved ventilation.  The pre-existing right pleural
 effusion has resolved, the right PICC line has been pulled back and the tip is
 now located at the confluence of the right subclavian vein and the superior
 vena cava. For correct positioning in the mid to low SVC, the catheter must be
 advanced by approximately 6-7 cm.  No complications. Unchanged hiatal hernia,
 minimally decreased atelectasis at the left lung bases and left pleural
 effusion.  No new focal parenchymal opacities.
