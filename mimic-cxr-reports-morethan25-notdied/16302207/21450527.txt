 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight increase
 in extent of severity of the preexisting parenchymal opacities.  On the right,
 there is unchanged blunting of the costophrenic sinus, likely caused by a
 small-to-moderate pleural effusion.  Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly. 
 Unchanged position of the tracheostomy tube.
