                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Male with polytrauma, reduced oxygenation.  Assess for pneumonia or
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___, 4:00 a.m., ___, ___, ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tip is 3.6 cm above the level of the carina and is in
 appropriate position.  Left subclavian sheath tip is in upper SVC.  Persistent
 low lung volumes with interval increase in bibasilar plate-like atelectasis,
 left greater than right.  Mild interval increase in heart size with persistent
 bilateral diffuse heterogeneous opacities with air bronchograms and
 interstitial and alveolar components likely  from mild-to-moderate pulmonary
 edema.  Interval increase in retrocardiac opacity from atelectasis and
 possible pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  Mediastinal contour and hila are
 normal.  No bony abnormality.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No significant change in mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Likely left lower lobe pneumonia with a component of atelectasis. Due to
 underlying vascular abnormality, pneumonia is likely underestimated.
 
 3.  Severe vascular congestion.
 
 Results were conveyed via telephone to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ on
 ___ at 10:30 a.m. within 10 minutes of observation of findings.
