                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube removal, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the right chest tube has been
 removed and there is no convincing evidence of pneumothorax.  Again, there are
 low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and probable
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, more prominent on the left.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, the possibility of supervening consolidation would have to
 be considered.
 
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place.
