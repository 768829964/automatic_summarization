 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no change in
 appearance of the previously malpositioned PICC line.  The power flush was not

 approximately 1 cm and new power flush attempt should be performed.
 
 No complications, the appearance of the lung parenchyma and the heart is
 constant.
