                                 FINAL REPORT
 PATIENT HISTORY:  ___ years old man with changing of oxygen requirements.
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of pulmonary edema and possible pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Exam is compared to chest x-ray of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Monitoring and support device are unchanged and in standard
 position.  In particular, the ET tube is at 6 cm from carinal bifurcation,
 unchanged since prior chest x-ray, can be pushed down few centimeters, left
 subclavian line is unchanged with tip ending at the origin of the SVC. Lung
 volume is still low with bilateral diffuse opacification for mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema.  There is  an improvement of the left lung base ventilation
 for reduced atelectasis; unchanged the severe right lower lobe atelectasis.  
 Persists cardiomegaly with central vein dilatation.  
 There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persisting moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema, with central vein
 dilatation and mild cardiomegaly.  Improvement of the left basal atelectasis,
