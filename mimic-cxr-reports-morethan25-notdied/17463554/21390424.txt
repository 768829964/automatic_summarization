                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with IPH, intubated  // serial monitoring
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right-sided PICC now terminates in the low SVC without evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Endotracheal and enteric tubes are stable in position.  There
 are relatively low lung volumes. Medial right mid lung opacity, slightly
 increased, may be due to atelectasis.  Persistent left base opacity appears
 slightly improved.
