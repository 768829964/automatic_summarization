                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with PMHx CVID (pancytopenia, hypogammaglobulinema,
 indwelling port for IVIg and transfusions) presented initially for MRSA
 bacteremia and meningitis/cerebritis complicated by septic shock, respiratory
 failure, and multiorgan dysfunction now s/p ex-lap for concern for ileus/SBO
 with possible pneumothorax on CXR.  // pneumothorax?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carinal. Right internal jugular line tip is in
 the right atrium and should be pulled back at least 5 cm is its position is
 desirable at the level of cavoatrial junction or above. NG tube tip is in the
 stomach. Right central venous line tip is at the level of lower SVC. 
 Widespread parenchymal consolidations are unchanged. No interval development
 of pneumothorax or pleural effusion demonstrated.
