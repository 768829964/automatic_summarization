                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypogammaglobulinema overwhelming sepsis here w/
 hypotension fever  // PNA
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest provided.   Left chest wall Port-A-Cath
 again noted with catheter tip in the mid SVC region.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable.  Lung volumes are low.  There is bronchovascular
 crowding likely accounting for lower lung opacities.  Scattered
 reticulonodular opacities likely represent areas of scarring in both lungs
 though difficult to exclude a component of atypical pneumonia.  The hila
 appear slightly congested.  No large effusion or pneumothorax.  Bony
 structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Scattered bilateral reticulonodular opacities, likely in part reflecting
 scarring though difficult to exclude a component of atypical pneumonia.  Mild
 hilar congestion.
