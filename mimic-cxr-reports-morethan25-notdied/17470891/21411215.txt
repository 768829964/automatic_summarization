                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bilateral pleural effusions, has left chest
 tube; intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure.  // Evaluate chest tube,
 evaluate for interval change.
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph, frontal view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 35 mm above the carina.  Right internal jugular central
 venous catheter terminates in low SVC.  Left pleural pigtail drain is in
 unchanged position.
 
 Left lower lobe is better aerated compared to ___.  Moderate right pleural
 effusion and right lung base atelectasis are increased.  Moderate left pleural
 effusion is stable.  Pulmonary edema is mild.  Mildly enlarged cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged and consistent with known pericardial effusion. 
 Tracheal secretion is present above the ET tube cuff.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate right pleural effusion and right lung base atelectasis are
 increased. Left lower lung is better aerated.  Mild pulmonary edema is stable.
 
 2. Stable enlarged cardiac silhouette is reflective of known pericardial
 effusion.
 
 3.  Trachea secretion is present above the ET tube cuff.
