 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the nasogastric tube has been
 removed.  The right IJ catheter again extends into the right atrium, and the
 endotracheal tube is in good position.
 The hemidiaphragms are poorly seen bilaterally in consistent with layering
 effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.  There is substantial volume loss in the
 left lower lung.  Cardiac silhouette is enlarged and there is indistinctness
 of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
