                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aspiration PNA, respiratory failure,
 intubated, with progressive hypotensive and anuria  // r/o eval PNA     r/o
 eval PNA
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial
 improvement in the appearance of the right hemithorax.  This could reflect
 decreasing pleural effusion and basilar atelectasis, though it also could be a
 manifestation of a more erect position of the patient.  Pulmonary vascular
 status has improved.  Retrocardiac opacification persists, consistent with
 volume loss in the left lower lobe and pleural fluid.
 Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
