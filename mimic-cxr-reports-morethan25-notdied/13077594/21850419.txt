                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with urosepsis, intubated // evaluate for central
 line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip terminates in the upper SVC.
 Endotracheal tube tip is slightly low lying, terminating approximately 2.6 cm
 from the carina.  Enteric tube courses below the left hemidiaphragm, into the
 stomach, with tip off of the inferior borders of the film.  Lung volumes are
 low.  Heart size is normal.  Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted within
 the aortic knob and descending thoracic aorta. The mediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Minimal
 patchy atelectasis is seen in both lung bases without focal consolidation.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified.  Mild degenerative changes are
 demonstrated within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Left internal jugular central venous catheter tip in the upper SVC.  No
 pneumothorax.
 2. Slightly low lying endotracheal tube tip, terminating approximately 2.6 cm
 from the carina.  Slight interval withdrawal is suggested.
 3. Standard positioning of enteric tube.
 4. Mild bibasilar atelectasis.
