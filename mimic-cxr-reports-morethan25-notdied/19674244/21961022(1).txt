                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___: ___M w HTN, DM, CAD s/p CABGx4, ESRD s/p renal tpx x 2
 admitted ___ w NSTEMI, CHF exacerbation, HCAP who presented with closed loop
 obstruction, s/p ex-lap, jejunal resection now s/p duod-jejun anastamosis and
 closure on ___  // S/p bronchoscopy    S/p bronchoscopy
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___ at ___:___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Partial aeration of the previously collapsed left upper lobe is compromised by
 re-expansion edema.  Left lower lobe remains largely airless.  Moderate right
 pleural effusion and indeterminate right basal atelectasis are unchanged. 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette difficult to assess when the
 left lung was collapsed is unchanged since earlier on ___.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 Nasogastric tube ends in the upper portion of a mildly distended stomach and
 would need to be advanced 5 cm to move all the side ports below the diaphragm.
 ET tube tip at the thoracic inlet should not be withdrawn any further.  Left
 jugular line ends in the upper SVC.  Left pleural drainage catheter still
 projecting over the left lower chest has been repositioned since ___:___
 suggesting that the new loop of what looks like a full wire projecting over
 its tip is instead sharply folded thoracostomy tube.  It is still present,
 relatively unchanged on the subsequent chest radiograph ___:___ on ___
