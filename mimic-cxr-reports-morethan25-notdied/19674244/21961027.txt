                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with urgent code re-intubation for resp failure
 s/p SBR now w/ worsening desats  // interval change     interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 06:10
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest radiograph ___ at 07:26 is submitted
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip 4 cm above the carina.  A feeding tube is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach.  A left
 internal jugular central line is unchanged.  There has been interval
 appearance of a diffuse airspace process in the left lung which in the setting
 of a recent code could reflect pulmonary hemorrhage or markedly asymmetric
 edema.  Infection would be much less likely.  Clinical correlation is
 recommended.  There are likely small layering effusions, left greater than
 right.  The right lung has improved aeration.  Given the diffuse abnormality
 in the left lung, assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is
 difficult in this patient status post median sternotomy.  Clips in the right
 upper quadrant are consistent with prior cholecystectomy.  No large
 pneumothorax is appreciated.
