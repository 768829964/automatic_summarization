                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with large R pleural effusion causing compressive atelectasis
 of RML and RLL s/p pigtail  // interval cxr     interval cxr
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___, no relevant change is seen.  The
 tracheostomy tube, the hemodialysis catheter and the bilateral chest tubes are
 in unchanged stable position.  A minimal pleural air inclusion at the
 insertion site of the left chest tube might be present.  The extent of a
