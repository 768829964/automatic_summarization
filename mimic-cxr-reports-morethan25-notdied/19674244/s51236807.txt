                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Nausea, vomiting, question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright as well as a lateral view of the chest was
 provided.  Midline sternotomy wires are again seen.  The previously noted left
 IJ central venous catheter has been removed.  Clips are noted in the right
 upper quadrant.  The kyphotic angulation of the T-spine causes distortion of
 the chest on the frontal projection.  However, allowing for this, there is no
 definite consolidation or pneumothorax.  Blunting of the left CP angle is
 stable and could represent a small effusion.  There is likely bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No signs of pulmonary edema.  Heart size is difficult to assess.
 Mediastinal contour is stable.  Bony structures appear intact.  No free air
 below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable, limited exam with small left effusion and probable
 bibasilar atelectasis.
