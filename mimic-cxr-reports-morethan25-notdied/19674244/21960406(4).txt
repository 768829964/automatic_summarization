                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new OGT.  // Please eval tube placement.    
 Please eval tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 4:06 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung apices are excluded from this study centered at diaphragm. Esophageal
 drainage tube has been repositioned, probably beyond the pylorus, not
 generally standard placement.  Bilateral perihilar consolidation is improving,
 presumably resolving pneumonia.  Moderate right pleural effusion is stable,
 but pulmonary vascular engorgement has improved.
 
 A left-sided central venous dialysis catheter ends in the mid to low SVC.  Tip
 of the ET tube is in standard position.
