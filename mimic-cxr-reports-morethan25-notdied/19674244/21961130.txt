                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man left pleural fluid collection s/p left pigtail
 placement  // ptx, left pigtail placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided PICC terminates in the right axillary vein.  A tunnel dialysis
 catheter is seen.  In the left internal jugular, terminating in the right
 atrium.  Lung volumes remain low.  There is persistent airspace opacity in the
 right lower lung, likely related to atelectasis as there is a moderate
 right-sided pleural effusion.  Prominence of the pulmonary vascular is
 consistent with congestive heart failure.  There is moderate cardiomegaly.  A
 pigtail drain is seen in the left upper quadrant.  No pneumothorax seen.  A
 tracheostomy is unchanged in appearance compared to the prior study.
