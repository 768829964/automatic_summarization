                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  CABG, evaluate infiltrate, edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ and allowing for technical differences, the possibility
 of a tiny residual left apical pneumothorax cannot be excluded.  Otherwise, no
 evidence of pneumothorax is identified.  Again seen is a left-sided central
 line tip over right atrium.  
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 grossly unchanged.  There is upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse
 vascular blurring, consistent with mild CHF.  Opacities at both lung bases
 consistent with bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation again noted.  The
 possibility of small bilateral effusions cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild CHF, similar to the ___ CXR, possibly slightly worse.  
 2.  Left apical pneumothorax is probably smaller.  A tiny residual
 pneumothorax cannot be excluded.  
 3.  Bibasilar collapse and/or consolidation, similar to the ___ CXR.
