                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient after CABG for assessment
 for the presence of consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly unchanged.  Bilateral pleural effusions
 are present with slight increase of the right pleural effusion.  Mild vascular
 engorgement is seen.  No definite evidence of pneumonia is present.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis might potentially obscure presence of infection.
