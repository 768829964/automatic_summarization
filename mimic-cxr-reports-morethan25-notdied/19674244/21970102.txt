                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year-old male with complex past medical history including CAD
 s/p CABG x4 , CHF with EF of 20%, ESRD secondary to FSGS s/p transplant x2,
 gastrostomy, COPD, with recently complicated medical course c/b respiratory
 failure now s/p trach with new pneumonia, with removal of b/l chest tubes  //
 eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since 2 days prior, bilateral parenchymal opacities have minimally improved. 
 Appearance on today's radiograph appears more consistent with moderate
 pulmonary edema rather than multifocal pneumonia.  Silhouetting of the right
 hemidiaphragm may be due to a combination of pleural fluid, atelectasis, or
 consolidation.  Crease lucency at the lateral left lung base is consistent
 with a persistent left basilar pneumothorax, best appreciated on CT chest
 dated ___.  Retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.  Severe
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal improvement in diffuse parenchymal opacities, which now appear more
 consistent with moderate pulmonary edema rather than multifocal pneumonia.
 Persistent left basilar pneumothorax.
