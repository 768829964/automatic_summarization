                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD, CAD, Influenza positive presenting
 with dyspnea  // Evaluate for consolidation/pulm edema      Evaluate for
 consolidation/pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 13:18.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 03:51 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post median sternotomy with stable cardiac and mediastinal contours. 
 Lungs appear slightly hyperinflated.  No pleural effusions pneumothorax or

 be appreciably changed since the earlier exam but could reflect an area of
 atelectasis, although early pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  Clinical
 correlation is advised and followup imaging may be helpful.
