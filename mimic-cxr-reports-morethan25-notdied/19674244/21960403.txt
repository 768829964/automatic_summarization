                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ESRD s/p txp, now p/w PNA  // interval
 change in intubated pt?      interval change in intubated pt?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 4:01 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Greater opacification is present in both lower hemi thoraces. Some of the
 difference is due to a change in patient position from semi-erect to  supine
 with more vascular congestion and more cephalad layering of pleural effusions
 as a result. Nevertheless I think the heart is larger, pulmonary vascular
 congestion is worse, pleural effusions are larger and there is increasing
 perihilar edema, all pointing toward relative cardiac decompensation.
 
 
 There is no pneumothorax.  ET tube is in standard placement, nasogastric tube
 ends in a nondistended stomach.  Left jugular line ends in the left
 brachiocephalic vein.  An esophageal measurement probe ends above the level of
 the larynx.  Clinical correlation advised.
 
 Sharp definition of the ET cuff reflects secretions pooling above it that need
 to be suctioned.
