                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p renal tx with positive flu now in respiratory
 distress  // Please evaluate for any new consolidations, edema, or
 pneumothorax
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Sternotomy wires are intact and aligned.  Lung volumes are low, but right mid
 to lower lung airspace opacities may be due to infection or atelectasis.  A
 left basilar retrocardiac airspace opacity may also be due to atelectasis or
 infection. The patient's chin and overlying soft tissues partially obscure the
 lung apices. But there is no obvious pneumothorax. Cardiomegaly despite the
 projection is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right mid to lower lung airspace opacities may be due to infection or
 atelectasis.
 Stable left basilar infection or atelectasis.
 No pneumothorax.
 Stable cardiomegaly.
