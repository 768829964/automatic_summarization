 As compared to the previous radiograph, the tracheostomy tube is in unchanged
 position. The pre-existing parenchymal opacities, notably at the left lung
 base, have minimally decreased in severity.  The lung volumes remain low. The
 presence of a minimal left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. Unchanged
 borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without overt pulmonary edema.
