                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with stroke, renal failure, desaturation,
 question worsening pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 934.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position.  Right subclavian PICC
 line continues to have its tip in the mid to distal SVC.  Overall lung volumes
 remain low and there is a bilateral patchy airspace disease which does not
 appear to be significantly changed given differences in positioning, technique
 and inspiration.  These findings could be consistent with diffuse pneumonia
 and/or pulmonary edema.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Patient's mandible
 obscures the apices.  No large pneumothorax is appreciated.  There are
 probable small bilateral effusions.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 difficult to assess due to the diffuse airspace process.
