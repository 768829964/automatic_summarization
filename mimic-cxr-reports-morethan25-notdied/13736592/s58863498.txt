                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Right thalamic hemorrhage with weakness and intubated. 
 There are no prior studies available for comparisons.
 
 Lung volumes are low. There is moderate cardiomegaly.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  If any there are small bilateral effusions.  There is mild
 vascular congestion.  ET tube is in standard position 6.5 cm above the carina.
 NG tube tip is in the stomach. Retrocardiac opacities are likely a combination
 of atelectasis and effusion,  aspiration cannot be excluded.  Followup is
 recommended.
