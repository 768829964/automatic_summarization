                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
 
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation, evaluation of nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects approximately 4 cm above
 the carina.  The tube could be advanced by 1 cm.  Normal course of the
 nasogastric tube, the tip of the tube projects over the middle parts of the
 stomach.  The pre-existing right internal jugular vein catheter is unchanged. 
 No evidence of complications.  Unchanged normal lung volumes with moderate
 cardiomegaly and minimal fluid overload, but no evidence of overt pulmonary
 edema.  Minimal retrocardiac atelectasis.  No pneumonia, no pleural effusions.
