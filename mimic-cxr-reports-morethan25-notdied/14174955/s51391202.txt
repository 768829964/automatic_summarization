                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  GI bleed, pneumonia, altered mental status.  Evaluate
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ at 06:07 dating
 back to ___.
 
 SEMI-UPRIGHT PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube is in
 unchanged and appropriate position, approximately 4 cm above the carina.  The
 right IJ central line and nasogastric tube are also well positioned.  The
 lungs are better aerated than on the prior radiograph from earlier in the day.
 The severe cardiomegaly as well as bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
 atelectasis are unchanged.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  The tortuosity of
 the aorta is also stable.  The pulmonary vascular congestion shows minimal
 improvement.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position, approximately 4 cm above the
 carina.
