 CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
 
 INDICATION:  Upper gastrointestinal bleeding, intubation, fevers and rising
 white blood cell count, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are in unchanged position.  There is a newly appeared right basal
 parenchymal opacity that could represent early pneumonia.  The presence of a
 minimal right pleural effusion cannot be excluded.  Unchanged moderate
 cardiomegaly and minimal fluid overload as well as tortuosity of the thoracic
 aorta.
