                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position
 with endotracheal tube currently terminating 4.6 cm above the carina.  Heart
 remains enlarged, and the aorta is diffusely tortuous.  Rotation of the
 patient limits comparison of prior study, but there has been apparent decrease
 in size of a right pleural effusion and apparent increase in a
 small-to-moderate left effusion.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.
