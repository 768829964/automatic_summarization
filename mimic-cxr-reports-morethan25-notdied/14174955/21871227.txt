                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  This is a ___ yo F with hx of CAD, systolic CHF, COPD, DM, HTN,
 atrial fibrillation, bradycardia s/p PPM, GI bleed (both lower and upper) who
 presented to ___ on ___ with acute diverticulitis c/b cardiac arrest X 2.
 // interval change; evaluate pneumothorax seen previously
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube remains present, tip approximately 3.5 cm of a above the carina. 
 An orogastric type tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm, off film.
 Right IJ central line tip overlies the right atrium.  A left subclavian a 
 left-sided single lead pacemaker, with lead tip over right ventricle. No
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Marked enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is again seen, similar
 to prior.  Today's examination is obtained with less oblique positioning. 
 Rounded density projecting lateral to the aortic arch is noted.  , the
 appearance is similar to ___ at 15:46.  This may reflect tortuosity
 and unfolding of the aorta with the patient still somewhat obliquely
 positioned.  However, attention to this area on followup films is requested.
 
 New on today's exam, there is hazy opacity at in the right mid and lower
 zones, with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm.  The appearance is
 suggestive of a layering pleural effusion with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Pleural fluid is now seen tracking along the right lung apex
 laterally.
 
 Increased retrocardiac density, with obscuration of left hemidiaphragm
 persists, compatible left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  A small
 left effusion cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 There is mild vascular and plethora and vascular blurring, consistent with
 interstitial edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New right effusion, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 Persistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Small left effusion
 cannot be excluded.
 
 CHF with interstitial edema.  I suspect this is more pronounced than on the
 most recent prior film.
 
 Persistent marked cardiomegaly.  Rounded opacity adjacent to the left aortic
 knob is similar to ___ and may reflect a tortuous on unfolded aorta. 
 However, attention to this area on followup films is requested.
