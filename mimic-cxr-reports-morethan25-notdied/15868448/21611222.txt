 WET READ VERSION #1 
 WET READ VERSION #2 ___ ___ ___ 7:57 PM
  Low lung volumes and bibasilar atelectasis.  New linear left mid/upper lung
  atelectasis.  Slightly better aeration of both lungs. Left pleural effusion
  layering posteriorly.  No definite pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy ends 4 cm from
  carina.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis, increasing peak pressures, question worsening edema, PTX. 
 _____.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:46 a.m.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 4.8 cm above
 the carina.  As before, there may be some opacification of the airway.  In
 addition, the right mainstem bronchus appears narrowed.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  There is increased retrocardiac density consistent
 with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and a small-to-moderate
 left effusion.  Mild vascular plethora is noted, but likely accentuated by low
 lung volumes.  New plate-like atelectasis is seen in the right upper zone. 
 Rotated positioning.  As before, the NG tube overlies the lower right chest,
 indeterminate in position.  If clinically indicated, lateral view could help
 to further assess this.  There may be some new consolidation in the right
 cardiophrenic region.  Again seen is a left subclavian central line.  This may
 have retracted slightly but overlies the proximal/mid SVC.  A left-sided PICC
 line terminates in a similar location.  _____ positioning.  This may account
 for prominence of the right-sided mediastinal silhouette, but does not account
 for non-visualization of the right mainstem bronchus.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at approximately 9:11 p.m. on the
 day of the exam (___, phone).
