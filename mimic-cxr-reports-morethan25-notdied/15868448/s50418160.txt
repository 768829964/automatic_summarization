                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:53 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with liver failure and ventilator associated
 pneumonia.  Evaluate progression of infection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Relatively continuous improvement in opacification of the right lower lobe
 over two days suggests it was due to atelectasis, not pneumonia.  Left lower
 lobe was clearly collapsed on ___ and is also better aerated, another
 site for atelectasis.  Upper lungs are clear.  Heart size normal.  Some
 pleural effusion is presumed, but difficult to assess because the diaphragm
 contours are so high.  Upper enteric drainage tube ends in a non-distended
 stomach.  Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.
