                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation for sepsis, question interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 19:25 p.m.
 
 An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 3.5 cm above the carina. 
 An NG tube is present, unchanged in configuration.  It overlies the cardiac
 silhouette.  It presumably is curled in the gastric fundus, though this cannot
 be confirmed on these views.  Left subclavian line and left-sided PICC both
 terminate in the proximal/mid SVC.  
 
 The patient is rotated.  Allowing for this, cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 enlarged.  As before, there is marked prominence of the right paratracheal
 soft tissues, more than would be expected from the patient rotation, of
 uncertain etiology or significance.  
 
 Compared with the prior film, there is worsened CHF, with marked vascular
 plethora, small-to-moderate bilateral effusions, and underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation.  Air bronchograms are noted at the right base medially. 
 Possibility of an underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Progressive CHF findings, with interstitial and alveolar edema.  Bilateral
 effusions and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  The possibility of an
 underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded.
 
 2.  Marked prominence of the right paratracheal-mediastinal soft tissues, of
 uncertain etiology or significance.  If clinically indicated, CT could help
 for further assessment.
 
 3.  NG tube as described, unchanged.
 
 Findings in items #1 and #2 were discussed with Dr. ___ at
 approximately 10:20 am on ___ (___, phone).
