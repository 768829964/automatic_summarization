                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of right internal jugular vascular catheter,
 terminating in the mid to lower superior vena cava, with no visible
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Interval
 improved aeration at left lung base with residual patchy and linear
 atelectasis remaining.  No substantial change in right basilar atelectasis and
 adjacent pleural effusion.
