  Multifocal opacities bilaterally, more confluent in the right mid and lower
  lung peripherally than on the recent CT, consistent with a worsening
  infectious process or asymmetric edema.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
  likely.  Support devices in stable positions.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sepsis and respiratory failure  // ETT
 placement      ETT placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there may be even further increase in
 bilateral pulmonary opacifications, especially on the right, consistent with
 some combination of worsening infectious process and asymmetric edema.  There
 is now an endotracheal tube in place with its tip approximately 7.5 cm above
 the carina. Nasogastric tube extends to the upper stomach, where it curls on
 itself before extending further.
