                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest x-ray.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sepsis, fevers, possible infection of ICD
 leads.  // Any evidence of pneumonia?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP projection.
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior exams available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a left upper chest pacer device with single lead projecting over the
 right ventricle. There are no apparent abnormalities associated with the
 device.
 
 The mediastinal silhouette and bilateral hila are normal. The cardiac
 silhouette is upper limits of normal.
 
 There are diffuse bilateral airspace opacities with indistinctness of
 pulmonary vasculature which likely represents increased pulmonary vascular
 pressures with moderate pulmonary edema. However, in the setting of fevers and
 concern for sepsis, especially given left lower lobe volume
 loss/opacification, this appearance is also concerning for bilateral
 pneumonia.
 
 There is a probable small left pleural effusion. There is no right effusion.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Bilateral diffuse airspace opacities which may represent pulmonary edema, but
 is also concerning for bilateral pneumonia given clinical context. Probable
 small left pleural effusion.
