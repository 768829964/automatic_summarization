                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)CHEST (PA AND LAT)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man  // eval effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to large right and moderate left pleural effusions have both
 increased since ___.  Pleural fluid exaggerates the extent of
 abnormality in the lungs, but there is probably mild pulmonary edema.
 Consolidation persists at the lung bases particular the left,, the right lower
 lobe is probably collapsed, and and small nodules, some cavitated, can be seen
 in both lungs. If more precise assessment of the lung status is required,
 chest CT scanning is needed.
 
 Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view. Right PIC line ends in
