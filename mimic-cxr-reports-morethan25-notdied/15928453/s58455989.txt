 INDICATION:  Patient with history of ischemic bowel, assess for ET tube
 position.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable upright view of the chest demonstrates endotracheal tube terminating
 4.5 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is positioned within the stomach. 
 Large right lung base consolidation seen on study obtained nine hours prior
 has significantly improved.  A small opacity remains in the right middle lobe,
 which obscures right cardiac border.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
 Hilar and mediastinal silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart size is normal. 
 Surgical clips, IVC filter and ___ project over partially imaged upper
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 In comparison to study obtained nine hours prior, the right lung base opacity
 has significantly improved.  Left mid lung opacities persist, which may
 represent atelectasis or infection in the appropriate clinical setting.
