                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is some decrease in the
 opacification at the left base, most consistent with improving atelectasis. 
 However, in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia would have
 to be considered.  There is also a somewhat hazy area of opacification in the
 left mid zone, superimposed on the lower margin of the scapula.  Again, this
 could possibly represent an area of consolidation.
 
 The cardiac silhouette remains within normal limits.  There is some
 indistinctness of pulmonary vessels, suggestive of elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.  
 
 Nasogastric tube is now in place with the tip in the upper stomach.  However,
 the sidehole lies within the lower esophagus.
