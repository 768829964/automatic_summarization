                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bowel resection with fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  There is some increased opacification at
 the right base worrisome for pneumonia.  Bilateral atelectatic changes are
 seen at the bases.  The area of questioned increased opacification in the left
 mid zone is somewhat obscured by overlying material on the patient.
