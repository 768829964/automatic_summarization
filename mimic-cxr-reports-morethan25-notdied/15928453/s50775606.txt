 PORTABLE CHEST, ___  
 
 Comparison to previous study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval change in pleural catheter with placement of pigtail
 pleural catheter terminating in the mid right hemithorax.  Associated decrease
 in size of right pneumothorax with residual small-to-moderate apical lateral
 pneumothorax remaining, with apical visceral pleural line just below the third
 posterior right rib.  Patchy and linear opacities at the lung bases most
 likely represent atelectasis, and note is made of an apparent small left
 pleural effusion.
