                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM, ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with complicated past history including
 small bowel resection, C. diff colitis and iatrogenic apical right
 pneumothorax status post clamping.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 PA and lateral views of the chest are submitted dated ___ at ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right pigtail catheter remains in place.  There continues to be a
 small-to-moderate right apical lateral pneumothorax now with a small component
 of air noted at the lateral aspect of the right costophrenic sulcus. Compared
 to multiple previous studies dating back to ___, the pneumothorax is
 smaller than on ___ but is more sizeable than noted on the ___ study from
 7:43 in the morning, and is  is slightly increased from the two other studies
 on ___ at 8:17 and 11:12 a.m.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle
 likely reflects a small effusion or pleural thickening.  No focal airspace
 consolidation or pulmonary edema.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are stable.  Results were communicated to Dr. ___ by phone on ___
 at 4:10 p.m. at the time of discovery.
