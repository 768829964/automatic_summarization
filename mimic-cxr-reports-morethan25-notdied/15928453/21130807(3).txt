 PA AND LATERAL CHEST FILM ___ AT 11:12
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with complicated past medical history
 including small bowel resection, C. diff colitis and an iatrogenic apical

 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 8:17.
 
 A PA and lateral view of the chest ___ at 11:12 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The right pigtail catheter remains in place.  There is minimal
 subcutaneous emphysema within the right lateral chest wall.  The right apical
 pneumothorax has slightly increased in size as there is now a lateral
 component that can be visible down to the level of the mid chest.  No
 pulmonary edema or focal airspace consolidation to suggest pneumonia. 
 Blunting of the left costophrenic angle which may reflect a small effusion or
 pleural thickening.  Previously described rounded opacity on the lateral
