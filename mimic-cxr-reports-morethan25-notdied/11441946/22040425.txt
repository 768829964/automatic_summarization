                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with as above  // s/p trach change
 w/tachypnea-check placement      s/p trach change w/tachypnea-check placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with these study of ___, there is increased
 opacification at the bases with obscuration of the hemidiaphragms.  This is
 consistent with layering effusions and compressive atelectasis at the bases. 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, it would be very difficult to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a lateral view.
 Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
