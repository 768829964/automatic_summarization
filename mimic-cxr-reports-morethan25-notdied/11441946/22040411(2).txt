 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG- CTs d/c'd  // evaluate for
 pneumothorax      evaluate for pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the left chest tube has been
 removed and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Other monitoring and
 support devices appear stable.  Bibasilar opacification, more prominent on the
