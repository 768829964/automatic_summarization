 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___, the tracheostomy tube is unchanged. 
 Lung volumes have slightly increased.  Bibasilar opacifications most likely
 represent atelectatic changes with possible small effusions.  However, in the
 appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 considered.
 The cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal or mildly enlarged. 
 Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some elevation of
 pulmonary venous pressure, which appears to be improved.
