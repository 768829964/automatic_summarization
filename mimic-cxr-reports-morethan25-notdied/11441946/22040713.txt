                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with trach, agitation, PNA  // Eval for interval
 change      Eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right PICC line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  Tracheostomy is in place. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  There is interval progression of
 bibasal opacities, most likely representing infectious process. There is
 slight increase in interstitial opacities in the perihilar area that might
 represent in addition progression of interstitial edema.  Graft a combination
 of both infectious process potentially in the low lungs and pulmonary edema
 might represent hypoxia and explain patient's symptoms.
