                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR ___, ___; CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  Since
 ___, there has been interval removal of the tracheostomy.  A dialysis
 catheter ends in the distal SVC. Aeration of the lungs has improved. Pulmonary
 vasculature is engorged without overt pulmonary edema.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions with adjacent atelectasis are tiny on the right and small on the
 left, unchanged. Chronic mild cardiomegaly is seen.  Mediastinal contours are
 normal.  A gastrostomy tube projects over the upper abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Pulmonary vascular congestion without overt pulmonary edema. Improved lung
 aeration since ___.
 2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, left larger than right, are similar to the
 prior study.
 
 Preliminary findings discussed with Dr. ___ by phone 1:22am ___.
