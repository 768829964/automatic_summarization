                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with endocarditis status post repeat TEE. 
 Evaluation for OG tube and ET tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiograph of the chest from ___.  The study is read in conjunction with CT of the abdomen from ___ at ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates orogastric tube in
 standard position in the stomach.  The endotracheal tube terminates 3.2 cm
 above the level of the carina.  A left subclavian line is in standard
 position, terminating in the mid-to-low SVC.  The lungs demonstrate mild
 bibasilar atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or focal
 consolidation. There is minimal pulmonary vascular congestion.  
 
 CONCLUSION:  Mild bibasilar atelectasis and minimal pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Orogastric feeding tube, endotracheal tube and left subclavian
 line are all in standard position.  Esophageal dilatation seen on recent
 outside CT of the abdomen is not appreciated on this study but should be
 followed up with subsequent imaging.
