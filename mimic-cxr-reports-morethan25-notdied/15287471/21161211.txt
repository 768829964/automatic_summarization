                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Hypertensive crisis at the first session of HD.  Evaluate
 for worsening pulmonary edema or aortic dissection.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema has worsened.  Cardiac size is obscured by
 the lung abnormalities.  Bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectases
 have increased.  There is no pneumothorax.  Central catheters and NG tube are
 in unchanged position.  Mediastinum is stable.
