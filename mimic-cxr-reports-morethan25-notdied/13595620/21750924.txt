                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with shock noew line placement  // ? left ij
 placement, ptx?
 
 COMPARISON:  Same-day chest radiographs.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube cough appear slightly over distended and forms an
 impression on the trachea. New left internal jugular venous catheter
 terminates at the junction of the left brachiocephalic vein and the superior
 vena cava.  No pneumothorax. Heterogeneous opacities in the right lung appear
 slightly improved compared to the exam ___ min prior but there has been
 interval development of retrocardiac opacity consistent with left lower lobe
 atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Overinflated ETT cuff.
 
 2.  New left IJ catheter terminates at the junction of left brachiocephalic
 vein and the superior vena cava. No pneumothorax.
 
 3. New left lower lobe atelectasis with minimally improved heterogeneous right
 lung opacities.
