                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.  Evaluate for edema, infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable erect AP chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  There is a left basilar opacity
 which may reflect pleural fluid or atelectasis. However, an infectious process
 cannot be excluded. There is no definite pneumothorax.  A left-sided pacemaker
 is seen with its leads projecting over the right atrium and right ventricle,
 expected locations.    
 
 IMPRESSION: Left basilar opacity may reflect pleural fluid or atelectasis.
 However, an infectious process cannot be excluded. PA and lateral chest
 radiographs would be helpful for further evaluation, if patient can tolerate
 it.
