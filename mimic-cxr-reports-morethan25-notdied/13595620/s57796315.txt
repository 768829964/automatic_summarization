 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates a right chest wall
 pacing device with leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle.  The heart
 remains enlarged.  There is again mild vascular congestion .  Mildly increased
 retrocardiac opacity with volume loss likely represents atelectasis. No focal
 consolidation or large pleural effusion is identified. There is no
 pneumothorax. The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild vascular congestion.
 2. Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.
 3. Retrocardiac opacity with volume loss likely represents atelectasis.
