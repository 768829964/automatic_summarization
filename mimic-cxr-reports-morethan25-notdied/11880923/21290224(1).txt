                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Confirm endotracheal tube placement in a patient status post
 ABO-incompatible liver transplant.
 
 COMPARISON:  A series of radiographs dating back to ___, most
 recently from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube terminates no less than 3.4 cm above the
 carina.  An orogastric tube terminates within the stomach with the side port
 near the gastroesophageal junction.  A left internal jugular central venous
 line terminates in the mid SVC.  A right subclavian triple-lumen catheter
 terminates in the lower SVC.  There has been interval reduction in heart size
 as well as marked improvement in pulmonary edema.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions are slightly smaller.  There is a persistent left retrocardiac
 opacity.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube is appropriately positioned,  3.4 cm above the carina.
 2.  The orogastric tube should be advanced by 1-2 cm to ensure that the side
 port is beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
 3.  Improvement in decompensated congestive heart failure.
 4.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity representing consolidation or atelectasis.
