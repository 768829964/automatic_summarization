                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with tracheostomy, bleeding
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None. Patient is currently listed as EU critical.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube tip terminates approximately 7 cm from the carina.  Right
 PICC tip terminates in the upper SVC.  Moderate to severe enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette is present.  The aorta is diffusely calcified and tortuous.
 Moderate to severe pulmonary edema is noted along with layering bilateral
 pleural effusions.  More focal opacities in the lung bases may reflect areas
 of atelectasis, however infection or aspiration cannot be excluded.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Tracheostomy tube in standard position.
 2. Moderate to severe cardiomegaly with moderate to severe pulmonary edema,
 layering bilateral pleural effusions, and probable bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Infection or aspiration at the lung bases cannot be excluded.
