                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right thoracentesis, here to evaluate for
 pneumothorax and evidence for lung reexpansion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The right PICC tip now appears to terminate in the right atrium and
 should be retracted 3 cm to place in the low SVC.  A tracheostomy tube is
 unchanged in position.  Multiple mediastinal wires are aligned and intact.  A
 tricuspid valve ring is noted.  In comparison to the most recent prior study,
 there has been interval right thoracentesis with significant decrease in size
 of right pleural effusion, now with small residual pleural fluid in the right
 lung base.  The right lung is well aerated.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The
 left lung base demonstrates persistent opacification, likely a combination of
 pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis.  Mild residual atelectasis is
 present in the right lung base.  There is persistent mild pulmonary edema. 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stably prominent.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right PICC tip in right atrium should be retracted 3 cm to place in the
 low SVC.
 2.  Significantly improved aeration at the right lung and decreased amount of
 pleural fluid, status post right thoracentesis.  No pneumothorax.
 3.  Persistent left basilar opacification, likely a combination of pleural
 fluid and underlying atelectasis or consolidation.
 4.  Unchanged mild pulmonary edema.
