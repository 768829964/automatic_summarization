                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female here for assessment of pleural effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT dated ___, radiographs dated ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest demonstrates tracheostomy in
 standard position and multiple intact median sternotomy wires.  A right PICC
 has low lying tip, which resides 6 cm below the carina.  This is minimally
 changed as compared to prior exam.  There are increased interstitial opacities
 in the right lung, compatible with pulmonary edema.  A small right effusion is
 present.  A previously seen left pleural effusion has largely resolved:
 Improved but residual retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis. 
 There is no pneumothorax.  Mildly prominent cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval development of asymmetric right pulmonary edema.
 2.  Slight reaccumulation of a small right pleural effusion.
 3.  Low lying right PICC tip at 6 cm below the carina.  If the goal is to
 place the PICC in the SVC, consider retraction by 2 cm. 
 
 Findings reported to Dr. ___ via phone by Dr. ___ at 11 am on
 ___.
