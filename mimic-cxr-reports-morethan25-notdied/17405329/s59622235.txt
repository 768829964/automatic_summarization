  New ET tube ends 4.8 cm above the level of the carina.  Asymmetric right lung
  greater than left heterogeneous opacities have slightly increased on the right
  and are not significantly changed on the left, possibly related to asymmetric
  pulmonary edema versus an atypical infectious process.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation, endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.6 cm above the carina.
 The course of the nasogastric tube is changed, with the tip now projecting
 over the prepyloric region.  The venous introduction sheath on the left is
 constant.
 
 Minimally increasing signs of pulmonary edema on the right.  Otherwise, the
 radiograph is unchanged.  There is no evidence of complications, notably no
 pneumothorax.
