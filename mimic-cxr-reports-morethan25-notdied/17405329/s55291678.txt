                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Mitral valve endocarditis, preoperative assessment.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Two views of the chest were obtained and reviewed.
 
 The right internal jugular line appears to be still low in the right atrium
 and should be pulled back additional 3.5 cm.  Heart size and mediastinum
 unchanged in appearance with prominence of the main pulmonary artery.  Sternal
 wires are stable.  The widespread parenchymal opacities are most likely a
 combination of interstitial pulmonary edema, pleural effusion and multifocal
 consolidations.
