 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:30 PM
  1. Comparison with prior exams somewhat limited due to technical differences
  in projection, but exam appears generally unchanged from prior exams.  2.
  Small right pneumothorax not well visualized due to differences in projection,
  but likely unchanged from prior images earlier the same day.  No left
  pneumothorax.  3. Right mid and lower lobe opacities unchanged, likely
  representing atelectasis but cannot exclude aspiration or pneumonia in the
  right clinical context.  Findings communicated to Dr. ___ at 11:28 p.m. on

 WET READ VERSION #1 
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Followup pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed five hours earlier.
 
 Right pneumothorax is less conspicuous than before but this is due to
 difference in positioning of the patient.  Cardiac size is top normal. 
 Mediastinum is stable.  Bilateral effusions larger on the right side with
 adjacent consolidations larger on the right size are unchanged.  There are no
 other interval changes.
