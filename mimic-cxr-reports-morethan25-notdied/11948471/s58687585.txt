                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure secondary to tension pneumothorax, here to
 evaluate interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax is unchanged in
 extent from ___.  Emphysema/COPD is unchanged.  Mass-like opacities in the
 right lung base are again seen.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions,
 which are unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits
 and unchanged.  A tracheostomy tube, enteric feeding tube, right IJ central
 venous catheter and right pleural pigtail catheter are unchanged in position. 
 The amount of subcutaneous emphysema along the right lateral chest wall is
 similar to the prior study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change in extent of small-to-moderate right apical
