                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent pneumothorax status post chest tube placement.  Evaluate
 interval change.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiographs dated ___, ___, and
 ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Redemonstrated is a chest tube is seen terminating in the right middle lung
 field.  There has been a slight interval increase in the degree of
 subcutaneous emphysema seen in the soft tissues of  the right chest wall.  The
 entire right lung is now reexpanded, and there is no residual pneumothorax
 identified.  Patchy and streaky opacities within the right lower and middle
 lobes are are now more prominant, and may represent aspiration.  The left lung
 is grossly clear.  There is no evidence of pleural effusion or frank pulmonary
 edema.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Redemonstrated are
 endotracheal and nasogastric tubes and unchanged locations.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. No evidence of residual pneumothorax.  
 
 2. Increased prominance of patchy and streaky airspace opacities in the right
 middle and lower lobes. These findings may represent aspiration in the
 appropriate clinical setting.
