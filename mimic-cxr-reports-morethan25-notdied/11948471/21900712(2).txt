 INDICATION:  Increased crepitus and decreased return volume.  Evaluate for

 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 5:02.  Chest radiograph

 from the carina.  A right internal jugular catheter is in unchanged position
 with the tip in the low SVC.  A right-sided pigtail chest tube is unchanged.
 
 Again, there is moderate subcutaneous emphysema, unchanged from the prior
 exam.  There is a small right apical pneumothorax, also unchanged from the
 prior exam.  There is no left pneumothorax.  Opacification at the right base
 is stable.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  There is no new
