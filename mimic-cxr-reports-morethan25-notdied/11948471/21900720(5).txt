                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated patient requiring Dobbhoff feeding tube, here to
 evaluate Dobbhoff placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed one hour earlier.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  Multiple attempts were made to place a Dobbhoff feeding tube with
 the final position of the weighted tip coiled in the left upper quadrant,
 likely in the stomach.  A nasogastric tube, tracheostomy tube, right internal
 jugular central venous catheter and right pleural pigtail catheter are
 unchanged in position.  Overall, the appearance of the right hemithorax is
 unchanged with significant subcutaneous emphysema and similar size of
 small-to-moderate right apical pneumothorax.  Opacities in the right lung base
 are unchanged.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are again seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Dobbhoff feeding tube placement with final coiled position in the
 stomach.
