                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Pneumothorax, status post valve placement by Interventional
 Pulmonology.  Evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 4:20.  Chest radiograph
 from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in unchanged position 5.1 cm from the
 carina.  Since the prior exam, the catheter in the right main stem bronchus
 has been removed.  There is a new valve overlying the right hilum.  Its exact
 positioning is difficult to determine on this single AP view.  A right chest
 tube is in unchanged position.
 
 Since prior exam, the right apical pneumothorax is unchanged.  There is
 increased linear consolidation in the right mid lung zone, likely due to
 increased atelectasis.  The opacity at the right base is unchanged.  There is
 likely a tiny right pleural effusion.  The left lung is clear without an
 opacity.  A small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  There is no left
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New valve overlies the right hilum.  Its exact location is difficult to
 determine on this single AP radiograph.
 2.  Increased atelectasis in the right mid lung zone.
 3.  Otherwise, unchanged radiograph, including a small right apical
 pneumothorax.
