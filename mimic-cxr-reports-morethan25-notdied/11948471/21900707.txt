                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pleuritic chest pain, rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a small linear
 structure paralleling the upper right chest wall that could mimic a pleural
 interface.  Other than expected for a pneumothorax, however, there is no
 change in radiodensity beyond this linear structure.  Therefore, this
 structure is likely reflecting an interstitial lung component, for example,
 the wall of a bulla.  There continues to be no clear evidence for the presence
 of a pneumothorax.  Severe hyperinflation, as previously described, persists,
 likely caused by severe emphysema.  Normal size of the cardiac silhouette.  No
 pneumonia, no pleural effusions, no pulmonary edema.
