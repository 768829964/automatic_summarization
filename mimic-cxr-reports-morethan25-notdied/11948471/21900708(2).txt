                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 9:04 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Tension pneumothorax.  Air leak.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 3:58 p.m.
 
 Volume of the small residual right pneumothorax is probably unchanged, with
 some pleural fluid replacing air at the base and small residual of pleural air
 at the apex.  Large region of consolidation in the right lower lobe which was
 not present prior to the exacerbation of pneumothorax and its treatment with
 pleural drain has progressed since the earlier study raising concern for
 either rapidly developing pneumonia or pulmonary bleeding.  Left lung is
 clear.  Heart size is increased, but still normal.  Right pleural drainage
 catheter unchanged in its position along the right chest wall.  Subcutaneous
 emphysema in the soft tissues of the axilla, decreasing.  ET tube and upper
 enteric drainage tube in standard placements, unchanged.
