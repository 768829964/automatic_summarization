                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Previous pneumothorax, now with tracheostomy and acute hypoxemia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring
 and support devices remain in place.  Right chest tube is again seen and is
 little change in the small apical pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema
 along the right lateral chest wall.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette and left
 lung are essentially unchanged.  There may be some increasing opacification at
 the right base, raising the possibility of aspiration.
