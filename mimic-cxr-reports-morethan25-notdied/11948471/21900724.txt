                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM, ___ AT 4:51
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with tension pneumothorax, COPD, question
 worsening.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 3:30
 a.m.
 
 A semi-erect portable chest film ___ at 4:51 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tracheostomy tube and right internal jugular central line are unchanged in
 position.  A feeding tube remains in position with its tip coursing below the
 diaphragm and not identified.  A right pleural pigtail catheter remains in
 place.  There continues to be extensive right lateral chest wall subcutaneous
 emphysema.  Lungs remain hyperinflated with parenchymal distortion consistent
 with underlying emphysema.  The small-to-moderate right apical lateral
 pneumothorax is likely unchanged given differences in patient positioning. 
 There are possibly small bilateral effusions.  A more rounded opacity at the
 right medial lung base is unchanged.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are stable.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.
