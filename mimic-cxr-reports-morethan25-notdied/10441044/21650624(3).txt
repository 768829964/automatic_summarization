                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Known left pneumothorax, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 11:46 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the basal extent of the
 known left pneumothorax has slightly decreased.  On the other hand, an apical
 component of the pneumothorax with a dimension of approximately 1 cm has
 become visible.  There also is a paramediastinal component of the
 pneumothorax.  Overall, the severity of the pneumothorax does not appear to
 have changed.
 
 Minimally increasing opacity at the right lung base.  Unchanged borderline
 size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged monitoring and support devices.
