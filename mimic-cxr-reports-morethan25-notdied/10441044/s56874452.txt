                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male status post MVC with possible aspiration during
 intubation, bilateral frontal hematoma, and rib fractures, now requiring
 assessmenet of ET tube position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from earlier the same
 day, ___ and CTA chest from earlier the same day, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube is located 5.4 cm above the carina.  There is no
 pneumothorax or other complication.  Lung volumes have improved.  There is
 less vascular congestion than on previous exam.  There are bibasilar
 opacities, likely representing the atelectasis seen on prior CT.  The left
 lower lobe is better aerated.  The right lower lobe and right upper lobe are
 collapsed.  There is stable mediastinal widening, corresponding with
 lipomatosis seen on prior CT.  A feeding tube passes along the expected path
 to the stomach and out of view.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  ET tube in appropriate position.  Right lower lobe and right
 upper lobe collapse.  Improved aeration of the left lower lobe.  Improved
 vascular congestion.
