                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Worsening hypoxia, intubated with ARDS, assess for recurring
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a same day earlier in the
 morning.  
 
 There is a new or newly apparent very large left pneumothorax with shifting of
 the cardiomediastinum towards the right.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged
 position, including a left apical chest tube.  Right lower lobe opacity is
 unchanged.  A followup radiograph was already performed at the time of the
 dictation of this study and the pneumothorax has markedly improved.
