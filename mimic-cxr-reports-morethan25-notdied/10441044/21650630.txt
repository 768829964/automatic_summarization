                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, again the side
 hole of the NG tube appears to be above the level of the hemidiaphragm. 
 Endotracheal tube remains in place.  Left chest tube is again seen and there
 is no pneumothorax.  Bibasilar opacifications suggests some combination of
 elevated pulmonary venous pressure, atelectasis, and effusion.
