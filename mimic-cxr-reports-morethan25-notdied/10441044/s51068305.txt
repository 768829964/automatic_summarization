                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 insertion of a left chest tube with reexpansion of the ipsilateral lung.  Mild
 atelectatic changes persist at the base.  Lucency in the costophrenic sulcus
 is consistent with some residual pneumothorax anteriorly in this relatively
 supine view.
