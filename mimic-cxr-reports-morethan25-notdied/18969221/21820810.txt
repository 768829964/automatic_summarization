                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status past tracheostomy and hypotension.  Bleeding around
 chest tube sites.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Severe scoliosis limits the evaluation of the cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 lungs.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged with stable widening
 of the mediastinum and cardiomegaly.  There is no evident pneumothorax.  Lines
 and tubes are in unchanged standard position.  Retrocardiac atelectasis are
 unchanged.  Small left effusion is minimally increased.  The sternal wires are
 aligned.
