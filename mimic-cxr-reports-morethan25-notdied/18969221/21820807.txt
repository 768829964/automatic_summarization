                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multiorgan failure. // new hypoxia,
 ?infiltrate, effusion worsening
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes which
 results in bronchovascular crowding.  Vague opacity in the right mid lung
 field may represent fluid in the fissure. There has been interval clearing at
 the right base, but there is persistent atelectasis at the left base. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged. Endotracheal tube ends
 3.1 cm from the carina. Left-sided central line and is approximately at the
 cavoatrial junction. The chest tubes project over the bilateral hemi thoraces.
 A nasogastric tube courses into the stomach in out of the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval clearing at the right base with persistent atelectasis at the left
 base.
