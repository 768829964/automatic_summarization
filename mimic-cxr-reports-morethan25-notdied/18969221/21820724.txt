                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with as above  // s/p repair of aortic disection
 w/acute hypoxia r/o PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Both components of the moderate to large right hydro pneumothorax have
 developed or increased substantially since ___ supine chest radiograph
 was taken. Because of severe scoliosis, it is difficult to say to what extent
 the mediastinum a shifted to the left, but the finding could reflect tension
 pneumothorax.  Moderate left pleural effusion and a substantial left lower
 lobe atelectasis are stable.
 
 ET tube, nasogastric tube, right transjugular Swan-Ganz catheter, are all in
 standard positions.
 
 At the time of this review subsequent chest radiograph, ___ at 00:13, was
 available showing placement of a right thoracostomy tube and substantial
 evacuation of the current large right hydro pneumothorax.
