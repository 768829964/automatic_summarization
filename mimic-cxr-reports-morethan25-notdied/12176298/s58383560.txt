                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Hematocrit drop.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ and ___.
 
 There is substantial new change which is a small amount of pneumoperitoneum
 which is most likely related to recent insertion of gastrostomy.  The extent
 of the right upper lobe opacity is unchanged as well as there is no
 substantial change in interstitial lung changes and basal consolidations.  If
 clinically warranted, correlation with repeated chest CT might be considered.
