                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY ON ___
 
 It is compared to multiple studies dating between ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post previous right upper lobe resection with
 similar postoperative volume loss and extensive apical thickening on the right
 compared to prior studies.  Widespread airspace opacities in the right lung
 appear slightly improved in the right lung base, and combined alveolar and
 interstitial pattern in the left lung appears relatively similar to the prior
 study.  Moderate right and small left pleural effusions are probably
 unchanged.  Diffuse haziness throughout the imaged portion of upper abdomen is
 suggestive of ascites.
