                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is status post right upper lobe resection, with a
 persistent large area of homogeneous opacification extending from the right
 lung apex to the level of the inferior aspect of the right fifth posterior
 rib, possibly representing a loculated area of pleural fluid.  Worsening
 opacification and volume loss are present in the remaining right middle and
 right lower lobes. Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened and is
 accompanied by combined alveolar and interstitial edema throughout the left
 lung.  The recurrent volume loss in the right middle and right lower lobes
 could reflect recurrent mucus plugging, but unusual postoperative
 complications such as torsion should also be considered in the appropriate
 clinical setting.
