                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change in a patient post bronchoscopy
 with recent right upper lobectomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___,
 5 hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed and
 compared to the prior study.  There is improved aeration of the right lung
 after bronchoscopy.  A known moderate right hydropneumothorax is visualized at
 the right lung apex; however, it has decreased.  Interstitial opacities in the
 left lung are unchanged and likely represent mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.
 No left-sided pleural effusion.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Again, post-surgical changes are noted including scattered clips
 in the right upper hemithorax, surgical ___ along the right lateral
 hemithorax, median sternotomy wires that are aligned and intact, and several
 right rib defects as well as defects within medial portion of the right
 clavcle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved aeration of the right lung status post bronchoscopy.  Known
 moderate right hydropneumothorax has decreased in size.
 2.  Left lung interstitial opacities consistent with mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema are unchanged.
