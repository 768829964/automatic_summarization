                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female, status post wedge resection and SVC
 reconstruction with occasional oxygen desaturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates no change in a
 moderate apical right pneumothorax.  The pleural catheter is unchanged in
 position along the right lateral thoracic wall.  An NG tube tip and side hole
 are visualized within the stomach.  Median sternotomy wires and right thoracic
 surgical clips are unchanged.
 
 Bilateral moderate alveolar and interstitial lung opacities, with superimposed
 bibasilar atelectasis are increased from the ___ film and similar to
 ___ film.  Moderate right pleural effusion is increasing. The heart
 size is normal, the mediastinal contours show an unchanged right upper
 mediastinal triangular opacity adjacent to the suture margin.  Partial
 clavicle resection and right-sided rib deformities with adjacent surgical
 ___ are again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral moderate lung opacities are worsened, previously waxing
 and waning course, are likely pulmonary edema, though infection, drug reaction
 or even hemorrhage could account for this appearance in the appropriate
 clinical setting. Moderate right apical pneumothorax is unchanged.
