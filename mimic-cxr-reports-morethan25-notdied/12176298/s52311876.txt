 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post right VATS, evaluation of hematothorax, chest tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone
 surgical removal of a large right hematothorax.  The previous pigtail catheter
 has been replaced by three right-sided chest tubes that are all in correct
 position.  There is a moderate post-procedural right pneumothorax and areas of
 substantial parenchymal consolidation in the apical and lateromedial aspects
 of the thorax.  The size of the cardiac silhouette and the appearance of the
 left lung parenchyma are unchanged.  Continues to be intubated and a
 nasogastric tube is in place, its tip is not included in the image.
