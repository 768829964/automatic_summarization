                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post right upper lobectomy, with desaturation.  Assess for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  Chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As before, there are four sternotomy wires, scattered right
 hemithoracic surgical clips, and skin ___ along the lateral aspect of the
 right chest wall.  There has been a marked increase in what is now
 near-complete homogeneous opacification of the right hemithorax with a slight
 rightward shift of the mediastinal structures, consistent with atelectasis in
 the setting of interval mucus plugging.  A portion of the known moderate right
 hydropneumothorax is visualized at the right lung apex.  Interstitial
 opacities throughout the left lung, more prominent in its mid-to-upper
 portion, are not significantly changed, consistent with mild-to-moderate
 interstitial pulmonary edema.  There is no left pleural effusion.  The heart
 size is difficult to assess but is likely unchanged.  Again noted are
 right-sided rib defects as well as resection of the distal portion of the
 right clavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New near-complete opacification of the right hemithorax, consistent with
 atelectasis in the setting of mucus plugging.
 
 2.  Partial visualization of known right hydropneumothorax, likely unchanged
 in size.
 
 3.  Left lung interstitial opacities consistent with mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema, not significantly changed.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 9:05 a.m. via telephone
 on the day of the study.
