                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post polytrauma, ventilator dependence, rule out
 effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the right subclavian line
 catheter has been removed.  The endotracheal tube and the vertebral
 stabilization devices are in unchanged position.  Unchanged course of the
 nasogastric tube.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Minimal opacity
 at the right lung base, likely caused by a combination of minimal right
 pleural effusion and small atelectasis.  No new parenchymal opacities. 
 Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
