                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with ethanol withdrawal and
 trauma.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is currently 5 cm above the carina.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unremarkable.  Left basal opacity appears to be projecting
 over the left lower lobe, unchanged since the prior study.  Mild vascular
 engorgement is present, but no overt pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
