                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 3:30AM.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with fever, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study dated ___ at 11:46.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 3:35 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There has been interval placement of spinal rods overlying the thoracic spine.
 An endotracheal tube has its tip cyst at the thoracic inlet and nasogastric
 tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  A
 right subclavian central line has its tip in the distal SVC.  There is marked
 patient rotation to the right, limiting evaluation of the cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  The right lung is grossly clear.  There is a subtle
 haziness to the entire left hemithorax which may be related to patient
 positioning or could reflect a layering pleural effusion.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  In addition, there is more focal airspace opacity in
 the left lower lung which could reflect atelectasis or early pneumonia. 
 Follow up imaging would be advised. No large pneumothorax is appreciated.
