                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with mechanical ventillation post-op bowel
 resection.  // ?interval change.      ?interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the patient has taken a
 much better inspiration. Areas of increased opacification at the bases could
 well represent primarily atelectasis. In the appropriate clinical setting,
 superimposed aspiration would have to be considered.
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place. With the better inspiration,
 the right IJ catheter extends only to the mid to lower pole SVC.
