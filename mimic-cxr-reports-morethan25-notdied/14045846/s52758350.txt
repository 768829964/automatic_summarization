 Right PICC line tip is in the proximal right atrium and should be pulled back
 2 cm to secure it position above the cavoatrial junction.  There is
 substantial interval improvement in the right upper lobe consolidation and
 left perihilar opacity with still present left basal opacity potentially
 representing residua of the infectious process.  Minimal opacity is still
 remaining in the right upper lobe.  Continued surveillance is recommended.  No
 appreciable pleural effusion is seen.  No pneumothorax.
