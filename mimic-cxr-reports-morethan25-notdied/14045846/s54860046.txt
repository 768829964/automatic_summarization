  New NG tube is coiled in the stomach and appears to terminate with its tip in
  the lower esophagus.  The costophrenic angles are indistinct, probably
  reflecting small effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  Developing infection in
  the lung bases cannot be entirely excluded.
  
   The findings were discussed via telephone by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ ___ on

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p resection of terminal ileum secondary to
 Crohn stricture with end ileostomy ___ p/w high ileostomy output s/p
 ileostomy reversal ileocolonic anastomosis, now with RR 40  // evaluate for
 any interval change, pulmonary edema, consolidation    evaluate for any
 interval change, pulmonary edema, consolida
 
 COMPARISON:  Conventional chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion, mild basal interstitial edema, mild increase in
 mediastinal venous engorgement and borderline cardiomegaly reflect cardiac
 decompensation.  This could be due to volume overload.  There is no focal
 abnormality to suggest pneumonia.
 
 Right PIC line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.  Nasogastric
 drainage tube is coiled in the stomach and terminates in the lower esophagus. 
 It should be advanced 5 cm to push the tip into the stomach.
