                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with LVEF of 35%, s/p extubation, now with
 tachypnea.  // Please assess for pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___.  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right PICC line ends in the approximate region of the cavoatrial junction,
 unchanged in overall position.  Lung volumes remain low. Asymmetric opacity in
 the right upper lung, increasing on serial exams is concerning for a
 developing pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly persists and is overall unchanged.
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema is improved.  The mediastinum appears
 widened, perhaps in part to the tortuosity of thoracic aorta as well as
 prominence of the venous system.    No pneumothorax.  No pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Likely developing right upper lobe pneumonia.
 2.  Improving pulmonary edema, now mild to moderate.
