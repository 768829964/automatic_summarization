                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p whipple for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, now
 with acute onset abdominal pain, tachypnea, tachycardia and diaphoresis  //
 r/o acute cardiorespiratory process     r/o acute cardiorespiratory process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, obliquity of the patient makes it
 somewhat difficult to evaluate the heart and lungs.  Again there are
 relatively low lung volumes with mild indistinctness of pulmonary vessels
 consistent with some elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.  No definite
 acute focal pneumonia is identified, though this would have to be considered
 in the appropriate clinical setting given the absence of a lateral view.
