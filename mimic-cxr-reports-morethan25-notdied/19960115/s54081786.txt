   Enteric feeding tube coursing midline with tip out of field-of-view.
  
  Persistently hypoinflated lungs with bibasilar atelectasis and bilateral
  pleural effusions.
  
  Interval increase in heterogeneous right upper lobe opacity is most consistent
  with layering pleural fluid, and vascular congestion.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p whipple, NGT advanced, please evaluate tip
 placement  // NGT tip placement      NGT tip placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The nasogastric tube is very difficult to see on these images.  A repeat study
 shows that the tip extends to the upper stomach, though the side port is in
 the lower esophagus.  It should be pushed forward several cm if possible.
 There continued low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette,
 pulmonary vascular congestion, and bilateral layering pleural effusions with
 volume loss in the lower lungs.
