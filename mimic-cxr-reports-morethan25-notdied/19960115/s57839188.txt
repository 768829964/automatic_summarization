 lateral costophrenic angle suggests an effusion.  There may also be a small
 right pleural effusion as well.  Left chest wall Port-A-Cath is again noted,
 catheter tip not clearly delineated but likely in the region of the RA SVC
 junction.

 Low lung volumes and probable bilateral effusions, left larger than right. 
 Superimposed mild edema is also possible.
