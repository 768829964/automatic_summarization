                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with productive cough and shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided Port-A-Cath tip terminates in the SVC.  Right-sided dual-lumen
 pacemaker device is again noted with leads terminating in the regions of the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  Moderate cardiomegaly has decreased in size
 compared to the prior study.  Similarly, widening of the mediastinal contour
 has also improved, with continued but improved mild to moderate pulmonary
 edema.  Moderate, multiloculated left pleural effusion has slightly decreased
 in size with unchanged trace right pleural effusion.  Thickened irregular
 pleural thickening is also noted bilaterally, as seen previously.  Patchy left
 basilar opacity likely reflects compressive atelectasis, however infection
 cannot be completely excluded.  No pneumothorax is present.  Compression
 deformities within the lower thoracic spine with associated kyphosis are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent moderate multiloculated left pleural effusion, but decreased in
 size from the previous study.  Unchanged small right pleural effusion and
 diffuse irregular pleural thickening.  Interval improvement in pulmonary
 edema, now mild to moderate in extent.  Left basilar patchy opacity may
 reflect compressive atelectasis however infection is difficult to exclude in
 the correct clinical setting.
