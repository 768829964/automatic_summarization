                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubated w pna // ?interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ at 1012am.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube appears midline and intact.  Enteric tube traverses the
 diaphragm.  Right PICC line ends in the low SVC, unchanged. Pigtail catheter
 projects over the right lower hemithorax and appears intact but its
 orientation has changed.  Lung volumes remain low, but slightly improved from
 the prior exam.  The right pleural effusion has slightly decreased in size,
 now small.  Left pleural effusion, if present, is small.  No pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Minimal interval improvement in aeration and decrease in size of small
 right pleural effusion.
 2. Interval change in orientation of right pigtail catheter - correlate with
 clinical assessment.
