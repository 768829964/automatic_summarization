                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated. Evaluate interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy and enteric tubes are unchanged.  Left PICC line appears to have
 been advanced, which may be a function of arm position, now terminating in the
 right atrium.  Lung volumes are low with obscuration of the lung bases
 bilaterally, a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Heart size is
 similar.  There is new pulmonary vascular congestion and moderate interstitial
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema has increased, as have
 apparent bilateral pleural effusions, however this may be secondary to supine
 positioning.
