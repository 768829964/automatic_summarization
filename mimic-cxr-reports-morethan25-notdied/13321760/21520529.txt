                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post exploratory laparotomy for small
 bowel obstruction, now with a postoperative re-intubation.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Median sternotomy wires are intact.  Endotracheal tube terminates 3 cm above
 the carina.  Nasogastric tube extends below the diaphragm.  Right internal
 jugular venous catheter is in unchanged position, terminating at the
 cavoatrial junction.  There is stable, severe cardiomegaly.  Stable
 enlargement of the thoracic aorta.  Apparent interval increase in size of
 bilateral, large pleural effusions is likely secondary to semi-erect
 positioning.  No pneumothorax.  Stable severe, right convex thoracic
 scoliosis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Unchanged, bilateral, large pleural effusions.
