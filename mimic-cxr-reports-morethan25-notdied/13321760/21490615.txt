                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post type A thoracic aorta
 dissection repair, evaluate for pneumothorax status post thoracocentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study obtained seven and a half hours earlier during
 the same day.  Status post sternotomy, tracheal intubation and right-sided
 internal jugular approach central venous line unchanged.  Cardiac enlargement
 unaltered.  The on previous examination existing basal haze on the right side
 has decreased and a local basal air-fluid level is now identified indicating
 successful thoracocentesis diminishing right-sided pleural effusion which was
 partially layered in posterior pleural compartments in this patient in almost
 supine position.  Left hemithorax remains unaltered.  There is no evidence of
 any pneumothorax in the apical area.  Position of NG tube unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Successful right-sided thoracocentesis, no pneumothorax.
