                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post cardiac surgery, evaluation for pleural effusions.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Extent of the pleural effusions is bilaterally unchanged, but given
 changes in patient position, they distribute in a slightly different manner. 
 There is evidence of mild fluid overload and moderate cardiomegaly with
 relatively extensive bilateral areas of atelectasis.  No pneumothorax. 
 Unchanged appearance of the sternal wires.  Unchanged right internal jugular
 vein catheter.
