                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with repair of aortic dissection.  Rule out effusion,
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest x-rays from ___ to ___,
 outside hospital CT scan of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 3.7 cm above carina.  NG tube ends below the diaphragm.  A
 right-sided Swan-Ganz is around the pulmonary valve or right ventricular
 outflow tract.  There is bilateral chest tube without visible pneumothorax. 
 Pulmonary edema has completely resolved since ___.  Right lower thorax
 opacity is probably due to subpulmonary pleural effusion that is unchanged. 
 Left perihilar increased density is stable since ___ and is of
 indeterminate significance could be related to pleural effusion, aspiration or
 pneumonia.  Two clamps are seen overlying the thorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tubes and lines are in adequate position.  There is no pneumothorax.
 2.  Pulmonary edema has completely resolved since ___.
 3.  Left perihilar slightly increased density is stable since ___, of indeterminate significance : loculated pleural effusion, aspiration
 or pneumonia couls be considered.
