 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post aortic repair, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The monitoring and support devices, including the bilateral chest
 tubes, are constant.  There is minimal improvement in transparency of the lung
 parenchyma, potentially reflecting improved ventilation or increased
 ventilatory pressure.  The endotracheal tube has not been pulled back.  The
 size of the cardiac silhouette is constant.
