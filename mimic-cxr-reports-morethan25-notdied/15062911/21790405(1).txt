                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Open chest at bedside.  Evaluate for effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  New skin ___ are present.  The right-sided chest tube with the
 tip against the upper lateral chest wall is now slightly curved against the
 chest wall.  The left lower chest tube is unchanged.  The feeding tube tip is
 off the film.  The left inferior lung base is still hyperlucent and there
 probably is a small inferior pneumothorax, less prominent than on the prior
 studies.  The Swan-Ganz catheter tip in the pulmonary outflow tract is
 unchanged.  Right atrial canula, bilateral pleural and midline drains are
 unchanged.  The ET tube tip is poorly visualized and is unclear where it
 terminates, likely above the thoracic inlet.  This finding was called to the
 CCU at the time of discovery on the film, and the team was already aware of
 the issue.
