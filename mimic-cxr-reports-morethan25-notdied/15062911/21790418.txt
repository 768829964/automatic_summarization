                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post RVAD and Bentall procedure.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  Mild widened mediastinum is stable.  Large left and
 moderate right pleural effusions are grossly unchanged allowing the difference
 in positioning of the patient.  Bibasilar opacities, consistent with
 atelectasis, have increased on the right.  ET tube is seen in standard
 position.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the mid SVC.  NG tube tip is out of
 view below the diaphragm.
