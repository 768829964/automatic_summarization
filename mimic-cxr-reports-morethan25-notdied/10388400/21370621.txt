                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate pigtail catheter placement, in a patient with a right
 hydro/hemothorax, severe C diff colitis, and hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from approximately 4 hours prior on the same
 day and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates an endotracheal tube
 which terminates in the mid to upper thoracic trachea, enteric tube which
 extends below the diaphragm and off the inferior edge of the image, and a
 right subclavian central catheter, which terminates in the low SVC, all
 unchanged in position.  There has been interval placement of a pigtail
 catheter which projects over the right lung base, with a decreased right
 pleural effusion.  There is a small right apical pneumothorax.  No focal
 consolidation is present.  The visualized upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of a right pigtail catheter projecting over the right lung
 base, with resultant decrease right pleural fluid.  There is a new small right
 apical pneumothorax.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  These findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___
 ___ to Dr. ___ at 15:34 on ___, immediately upon discovery.
