 A right subclavian central venous catheter extends to the low SVC. Nasogastric
 tube enters the stomach, tip not visualized.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is unchanged.  The splayed hilum
 is likely due to an enlarged left atrium.  The pulmonary artery is enlarged as
 in the past.  A small left pleural effusion with stable retrocardiac airspace
 opacification likely due to atelectasis are both unchanged.
