                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with HCAP with increased tachypnea and dyspnea,
 RR up to high 30s  // please evaluate for infiltrate, edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___ in ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left PICC line ends in the distal SVC, unchanged.  The left IJ ends in the
 brachiocephalic vein just to the left of midline, unchanged.  Enteric tube
 traverses the diaphragm and its tip is not seen, but the stomach is not
 distended.  Bilateral low lung volumes persist.  Large right pleural effusion
 and moderate left pleural effusion are overall unchanged since ___.  The
 appearance of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged with moderate
 cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax.  Previously described leftward deviation of
 the trachea at the inlet is not apparent today and suggestive is probably from
 rotational effect.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No significant interval change.  Decompensated herat failure.
