                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with shock, renal failure, volume overload on
 HD with resolving respiratory failure  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right subclavian access dialysis catheter tip is unchanged in position,
 ending in the mid to low SVC.  The nasogastric tube side port ends in the
 stomach.  The left PICC line ends in the mid SVC, unchanged.  A chest tube
 projects over the right hemithorax, unchanged in orientation.  Bilateral small
 pleural effusions, greater on the left, are overall unchanged.  Bilateral
 platelike atelectasis is slightly increased.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists
 and is perhaps slightly increased from the prior exam.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion and mild edema is minimally increased.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight increase overall pulmonary vascular congestion and mild edema as well
 as heart size.
