                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with endocarditis and new hypoxia  // eval for
 interaval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 04:18
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have slightly
 increased, potentially reflecting improved ventilation or increased
 respiratory pressure. As a consequence, the pre-existing mild diffuse
 parenchymal opacities have decreased in extent and severity. Borderline size
 of the cardiac silhouette persists. The monitoring and support devices are in
 unchanged position.  No pneumothorax.  No pleural effusions.
