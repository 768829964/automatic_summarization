                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with endocarditis  // eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST X-RAY FROM ___ AT 03:42. TARGETED REVIEW OF
 CHEST CT FROM ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 4.1 cm above
 the carina. An enteric type tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm,
 off the film. A left subclavian PICC line tip overlies the distal SVC. No
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 Compared to ___ at 03:43, the degree of opacity in both lungs
 appears to have increased slightly. Confluent opacity at the right chest wall
 laterally is similar to the prior study. The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 grossly unchanged. Mediastinal and hilar prominence is unchanged. No gross
 right and no left effusion.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Lines and tubes in satisfactory position.
 2. Slightly worsened appearance of opacities in both lungs. This is compatible
 with an infectious process, in keeping with findings on the ___
 CT scan.
 3. The possibility of a component of superimposed CHF would be difficult to
 exclude. No gross effusion identified.
