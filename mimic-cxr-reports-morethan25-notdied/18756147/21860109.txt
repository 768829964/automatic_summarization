                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with endocarditis and multifocal pneumonia  //
 eval for interval change      eval for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs's ___ through ___ at 3:31
 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has improved over the past 24 hours.  Moderate to severe
 cardiomegaly is stable.  Discrete Lung lesions are largely obscured by the
 persistent edema.  Pleural effusions are small if any.
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube, nearly 3 cm above the carina with the chin
 partially flexed is standard positioning.  The level of the upper esophagus or
 hypopharynx where the esophageal tube was looped yesterday may not be imaged
 on this examination, so I doubt note that loop has been reduced, but distally
 the tube  passes into the stomach and out of view.  An esophageal probe is
 still roughly at the level of the carina.  There is no pneumothorax.
