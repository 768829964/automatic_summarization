 present with the tip in the mid SVC. Since the prior exam, mild pulmonary
 edema has developed.  There has been little change in the peripheral nodular
 airspace opacities. No new opacity is identified. Tiny bilateral pleural
 effusions are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. The mediastinal contours
 are normal. Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  A radiopaque marker overlying
 the left upper abdomen is of uncertain etiology, and may be outside the
 patient.
