                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post Bentall with fever, to assess for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the Swan-Ganz catheter has
 been removed.  Tracheostomy tube remains in place.  The pulmonary edema has
 substantially decreased and post-operative widening of the superior
 mediastinum has decreased.  The costophrenic angles are more sharply seen and
 there is no evidence of substantial basilar atelectasis.  Vague suggestion of
 some increased opacification above the minor fissure.  In view of the clinical
 history, this could represent an area of consolidation since this was not
 present on the study of ___.
