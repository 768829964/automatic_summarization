                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman, status post Swan placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 SINGLE FRONTAL PORTABLE SUPINE VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Swan-Ganz catheter ends
 slightly more distally when compared to the prior study in the proximal right
 pulmonary artery.  The endotracheal tube ends approximately 14 cm above the
 carina.  Dobhoff tube courses to the stomach, although the tip is excluded
 from view.  An additional NG tube ends within the stomach.  A right-sided
 catheter sheath remains in place ending in the upper SVC.  Multiple surgical
 clips are noted in the right axilla.
 
 A widened mediastinum is in keeping with patient's known chronic aortic
 dissection and recent mitral valve surgery.  Aortic valve replacement is also
 present.
 
 Pulmonary edema has slightly worsened.  Increasing opacity in the left lung
 likely represents asymmetric pulmonary edema given appearance of recent prior
 studies.  There is no pneumothorax.
