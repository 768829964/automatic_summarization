                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Congestion.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right internal jugular central line ends at the superior
 atriocaval junction.  A tracheostomy tube is 3.7 cm from the carina.  A
 feeding tube is in the stomach with the tip out of view.  Sternotomy wires and
 valve hardware are intact.  The pulmonary edema has decreased from the prior
 study.  There is stable mild vascular engorgement.  Hazy opacification at the
 left base likely represents atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette has
 a normal postoperative appearance.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Decrease in pulmonary edema.
 2.  Left basilar atelectasis.
