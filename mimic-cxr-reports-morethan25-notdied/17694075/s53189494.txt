                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient after complex cardiac
 surgery.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 12:53 a.m.
 
 Since the prior study, there is no interval change in the mediastinal width
 and cardiac silhouette.  Minimal vascular engorgement is more pronounced on
 the current study might reflect small degree of pulmonary edema.  No change in
 bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis is noted.
