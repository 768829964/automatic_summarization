                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest view was read in comparison with prior chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Since ___, mild to moderate pulmonary edema has improved.  Left
 lower lung atelectasis reflected by increased retrocardiac density is still
 persisting.  Presumed small left pleural effusion is unchanged.  Enlarged
 heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  Monitoring and
 supporting devices are in standard positions.
