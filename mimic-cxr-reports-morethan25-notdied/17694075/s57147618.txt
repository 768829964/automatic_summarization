                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST DONE 7:47 A.M. ___
 
 HISTORY:  Possible pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 What was previously symmetrically distributed pulmonary edema in the right
 lung and left upper lung has become more heterogeneous.  This could simply be
 due to worsening pulmonary edema, but the possibility of developing pneumonia
 must be considered.  Left lower lobe is collapsed and moderate left pleural
 effusion is increased.  Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.  Dual-channel
 large bore central venous line ends at and just above the superior cavoatrial
 junction alongside a right PIC line.  Large cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable postoperatively.  No pneumothorax.
