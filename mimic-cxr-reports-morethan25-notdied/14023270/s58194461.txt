 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Abdominal distention, status post nasogastric tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous images, there is minimal progression of
 the pre-existing pulmonary edema.  The lung volumes remain low and the size of
 the cardiac silhouette is massively enlarged.  The course of the previously
 re-positioned nasogastric tube now appears to be normal.  There is no
 pneumothorax and there are no larger pleural effusions.
