                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic heart failure, exacerbation, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is progression of
 disease.  Low lung volumes remain unchanged, the pre-existing cardiomegaly is
 constant.  However, signs indicative of pulmonary edema have worsened.  The
 predominant abnormality is an overall increased radiodensity of the lung as
 well as increased vascular diameters.  There is no evidence of pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.  The position of the endotracheal tube is
 constant.
