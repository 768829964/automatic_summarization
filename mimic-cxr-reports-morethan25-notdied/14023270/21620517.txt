                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with CHF, COPD, CAD presents with progressive
 dyspnea, fluid retention, cough
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 CC is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Severe cardiomegaly is
 unchanged.  There is mild to moderate pulmonary edema, as seen previously. 
 The mediastinal and hilar contours are similar with atherosclerotic
 calcifications noted diffusely in the descending thoracic aorta.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions have decreased in size compared to the prior
 study.  Patchy atelectasis is noted in the lung bases.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  There are moderate degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild to moderate pulmonary edema, as seen previously, with severe
 cardiomegaly.  Trace bilateral pleural effusions, decreased in size in the
 interval.
