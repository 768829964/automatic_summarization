 contour is unremarkable.  There is crowding of the bronchovascular structures
 with mild pulmonary edema.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen.
 Retrocardiac and right basilar patchy opacities likely reflect atelectasis. 
 There are no acute osseous abnormalities identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes with mild pulmonary edema and probable bibasilar atelectasis.
