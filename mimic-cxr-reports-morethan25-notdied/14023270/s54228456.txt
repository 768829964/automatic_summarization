                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  PEA arrest with MSSA pneumonia and continued fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  This is a highly limited study due to technique and patient body
 habitus.  Cardiac silhouette is massively enlarged.  Lung volumes are
 persistently low with diffuse bilateral opacities with probable improvement of
 retrocardiac densities with increased aeration but with persistent right-sided
 and left apical indistinct opacity.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent scattered indistinct opacities with slightly improved
 aeration of the left lung base.
