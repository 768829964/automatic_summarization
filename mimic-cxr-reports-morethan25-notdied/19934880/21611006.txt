 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with MRSA spinal abscess s/p peg with worsening

 change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at 14 25
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP upright chest film ___ at 10:40 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Spinal hardware is now seen overlying the lower cervical and upper thoracic
 spine. Right subclavian PICC line is unchanged in position.  The nasogastric
 tube has been removed. An endotracheal tube remains in place with the tip
 approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.  There is improved aeration but
 persistent consolidation in the retrocardiac area suggestive of partial lower
 lobe atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There has
 been interval appearance of free air within the peritoneal space likely
 related to recent PEG placement.  No pneumothorax.
