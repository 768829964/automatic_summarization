                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia and fever. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Bedside frontal chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated. There are streaky retrocardiac opacities. No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Heart is normal size. There is no pulmonary
 edema. The mediastinal and hilar structures are unremarkable.
 
 Sternotomy wires, some fractured, and cervical hardware are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Streaky retrocardiac opacities may reflect atelectasis but pneumonia is not
 excluded in the correct clinical setting. If necessary, a lateral view could
 be obtained for further evaluation.
