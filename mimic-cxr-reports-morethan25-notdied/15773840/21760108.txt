                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Pneumonia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study of ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  NG tube tip is out of view below
 the diaphragm.  ET tube tip is high 9 cm above the carina, can be advanced a
 couple of centimeters for more standard position.  Right lower lobe pneumonia
 is unchanged.  Vascular congestion has improved.  Opacities in the left
 retrocardiac region are a combination of pleural effusion and adjacent left
 lower lobe consolidation has minimally improved.  Left basilar opacities have
 increased, worrisome for worsening pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.
