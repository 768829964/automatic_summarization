                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left lower lobe collapse.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___ at 01:50 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position.  Cervical spinal
 fixation hardware is incompletely imaged.  There is significantly improved
 aeration of the left lung base and definition of the left hemidiaphragm
 compatible with resolved left lower lobe atelectasis.  There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Resolved left lower lobe atelectasis.
