                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  C5 fracture and hypoxemia, question worsening pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  CXR from ___ at 15:02 p.m
 
 Slightly rotated positioning.  An ET tube is present, tip at the level of
 midclavicular heads, approximately 7.3 cm above the carina.  An
 orogastric-type tube is present, with radiopaque tip overlying the upper
 stomach.  
 
 There is increased retrocardiac density consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation and bilateral effusions with underlying collapse
 and/or consolidation at the right base as well.  Upper zone re-distribution,
 without overt CHF.  
 
 Deformity of both mid clavicles consistent with fractures, question old. 
 Possible right convex scoliosis.
 
 Again noted are lower portion of the cervical spinal fixation hardware and
 skin ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1) Smal bibasilar effusions and bibasilar collapse/consolidation and small
 left effusion, unchanged.  New small right pleural effusion.
 
 2) The ET tube is only very slightly lower.
