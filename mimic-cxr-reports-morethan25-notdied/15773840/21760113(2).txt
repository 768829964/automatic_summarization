 INDICATION:  New desaturation, evidence of mucus plugging.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The substantial atelectasis of the left lower lobe, potentially
 associated with a small left pleural effusion.  No pulmonary edema.  No
 pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.  The monitoring and support devices are in
