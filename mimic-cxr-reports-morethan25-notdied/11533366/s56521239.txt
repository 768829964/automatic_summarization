                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting.  History of lung and breast cancer
 as well as radiation esophagitis.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are present.  The patient's chin obscures evaluation of the
 lung apices.  There is evidence of volume loss in the right lung with
 elevation and tenting of the right hemidiaphragm.  Postsurgical changes from
 prior right upper lobectomy are again noted.  There is crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures, and fluffy opacification about the perihilar
 regions, more so on the right, may suggest mild pulmonary vascular engorgement
 or an infectious process.  Previously noted diffuse hazy opacification in the
 right lung has improved.  There is continued mild cardiomegaly.  The
 mediastinal contours are unchanged.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Partially imaged is a right humeral head prosthesis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Limited study. Postsurgical changes in the right lung following right upper
 lobectomy.  Perihilar fluffy opacities, right greater than left, may reflect
 mild pulmonary vascular engorgement but an infectious process or aspiration
 cannot be excluded. Consider repeat PA and lateral chest radiographs when the
 patient can take a deeper inspiration.
