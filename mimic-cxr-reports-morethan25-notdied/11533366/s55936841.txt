                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fall, acute mental status change with crackles on lung exam.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, chest CT ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest were reviewed. The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  Elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm is again noted with post-surgical changes in the right chest
 from prior right upper lobectomy.  Low lung volumes are again appreciated. 
 Slight increase in interstitial markings may indicate an element of pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Right shoulder replacement is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes with increased interstitial markings which may
 indicate mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
