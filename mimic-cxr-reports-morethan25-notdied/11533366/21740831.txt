                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray of ___.
 
 A technically limited chest radiograph was performed solely for the purpose of
 feeding tube assessment.  It documents the presence of a feeding tube with tip
 terminating in the stomach.  Within the imaged portion of the chest, there has
 been apparent extubation and removal of a nasogastric tube.  Postoperative
 volume loss persists in the right hemithorax in this patient status post
 previous right upper lobe resection.  Note is also made of pleural fluid
 and/or thickening extending to the right apex and geographically marginated
 opacities centrally in the right infrahilar region which may correspond to
 post-radiation changes.  Multifocal pulmonary opacities present predominantly
 in the left lung on prior CT of ___ have markedly improved with
 residual opacities predominantly at the left base.
 
 IMPRESSION: Feeding tube terminates in stomach.
