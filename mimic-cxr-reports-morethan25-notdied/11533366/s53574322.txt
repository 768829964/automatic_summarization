                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST OF ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Marked volume loss in the right lung is related to previous right
 upper lobe resection and radiation therapy as demonstrated on prior CT chest
 of ___.  Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size. 
 Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits allowing for relatively low lung
 volumes.  No focal areas of consolidation are present within the lungs, and
 there are no definite pleural effusions.  Scarring along the right
 hemidiaphragm contour appears unchanged as well as right apical thickening,
 likely related to previous lung cancer treatment.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
