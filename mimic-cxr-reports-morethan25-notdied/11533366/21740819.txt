                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, the upper lung opacity on the
 right has substantially increased in severity and extent.  The opacity is
 located at the region of former right upper lobectomy.  The short time course
 of the changes suggests infection rather than a neoplastic recurrence.
 
 The pre-existing opacity on the left, located in the lung apex, unchanged. 
 Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Mild retrocardiac atelectasis.
