                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST PORTABLE
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with acute liver and renal failure, possible
 HCAP edema, consolidation, evaluate for tube placement.
 
 CHEST PORTABLE:  Comparison is made to ___.  The ET tube is 3.6 cm from
 the carina.  There is cardiomegaly.  There has been improvement in the
 bilateral pulmonary opacities that likely represent pulmonary edema.  The
 opacification in the right lung apex and at the right lung base extending into
 the minor fissure are consistent with pleural effusion and these are stable. 
 A right-sided central venous line is identified with its tip in the distal
 SVC.  NG tube is noted to pass into the stomach.  The tip is not depicted on
 this film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement in patchy consolidation in both lungs.  This may
 represent resolution of pulmonary edema.  Pleural effusions in the right
 hemithorax are unchanged.
