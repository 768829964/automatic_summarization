                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Malaise, wheezing and low-grade fever.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs are available from ___ and more
 recent chest CT studies from ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral view.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lung volumes are again low.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged.  There is similar moderate to
 severe relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm compared to the left. 
 Compared to the prior radiographs there is increased widespread opacification
 of the right upper lobe which is also more prominent than on the more recent
 of the two chest CT studies.  This appearance is concerning for pneumonia
 superimposed on chronic scarring.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The patient is status post bilateral shoulder replacements.
 
 IMPRESSION: New opacification of the right upper lobe worrisome for pneumonia
 superimposed on more chronic changes.
