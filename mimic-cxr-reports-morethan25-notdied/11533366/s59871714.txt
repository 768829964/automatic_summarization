                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Shortness of breath in a patient after bilateral toes
 amputation.
 
 AP and lateral radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are stable in appearance.  Lungs are essentially
 clear.  Tenting of the right hemidiaphragm is unchanged in this patient who is
 most likely after right upper lobectomy.  Post-radiation changes are similar. 
 Overall, no interval development of pleural effusion, pneumothorax, or new
 consolidations demonstrated.  Replaced right humerus prosthesis is seen.
