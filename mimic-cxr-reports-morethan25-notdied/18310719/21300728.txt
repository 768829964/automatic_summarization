                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man post cardiac arrest with hypoxia  // ?ET TUBE
 position
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to prior radiograph from earlier today, endotracheal tube now
 terminates 3.6 cm above the carina and a nasogastric tube has been removed. 
 Lung volumes are low, accentuating the cardiac silhouette and bronchovascular
 structures.  Considering this factor, pulmonary edema has slightly improved. 
 Exam is otherwise remarkable for interval worsening of bilateral pleural
 effusions with adjacent basilar atelectasis and or consolidation.
