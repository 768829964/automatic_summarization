                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man a/w PEA arrest, now with oxygen requirement
 likely secondary to splinting, pulmonary contusions and edema, atelectasis  //
 evaluate for interval change, infiltrate     evaluate for interval change,
 infiltrate
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Lung volumes are extremely low, smaller than had any previous time and left
 lower lobe is now collapsed.  Right lower lobe atelectasis is only slightly
 less severe.  This degree of atelectasis is more than sufficient to explain
 respiratory insufficiency.  Lung trauma does not have to be invoked, and there
 is no pulmonary edema.  The upper lobes are clear.  Cardiac silhouette is
 obscured by the elevated diaphragm.  No pneumothorax.
