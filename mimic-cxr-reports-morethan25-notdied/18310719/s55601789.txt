                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, s/p PEA arrest. New OG tube placed  //
 for OG line placemenat      for OG line placemenat
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been placement of
 an orogastric line that is difficult to follow beyond the upper stomach.  If
 the precise position of the tube tip is of clinical importance, an abdominal
 radiograph could be obtained.
 Again there are low lung volumes with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette
 and probable bilateral effusions with basilar atelectasis, more prominent on
 the left.  Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels is consistent with some
 elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
 The endotracheal tube is unchanged in position.
