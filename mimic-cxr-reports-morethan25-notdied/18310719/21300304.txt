                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxemia  // eval for effusion      eval
 for effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___.
 
 Pulmonary vasculature and mediastinal veins are more distended, heart is
 larger but cardiac size is hard to assess because the  lung volumes are still
 low on the diaphragm is elevated.  There is no pulmonary edema as yet.
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are larger.  Bibasilar atelectasis is
 moderate on the right, severe on the left, presumably contributes to
 hypoxemia.   No pneumothorax.
