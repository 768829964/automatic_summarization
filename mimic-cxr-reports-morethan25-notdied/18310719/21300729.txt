 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with known OSA, COPD, CHF who had PEA arrest
 earlier intubated and now w sudden drop in saturation  // evaluate for flash
 pulm edema     evaluate for flash pulm edema
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are low lung volumes,
 which accentuate the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and degree of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  The bilateral pleural effusions with
 compressive basilar atelectasis appear stable.
 In view of the extensive pulmonary changes, low lung volumes, and size the
 heart, in the appropriate clinical setting it would be impossible to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia.
