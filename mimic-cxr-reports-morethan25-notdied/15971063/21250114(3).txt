                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage due to anterior communicating
 artery aneurysm status post coiling, now intubated, coughed up blood, chest
 tube placed.
 
 CHEST, FOUR FILMS SEMISUPINE:
 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube lies in the satisfactory position 4.5 cm from
 the carinal angle.  Some opacities are now seen in the left lung, which were
 not present on the prior chest x-ray taken at 5 a.m. and these could represent
 areas of hemorrhage or aspiration.  The right lung appears clear.
