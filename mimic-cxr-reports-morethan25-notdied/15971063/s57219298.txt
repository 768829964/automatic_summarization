 PICC line has its tip in the proximal SVC.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are stable.  There continues to be a layering left effusion with
 retrocardiac consolidation likely representing partial lower lobe atelectasis.
 Remaining lungs are clear.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.  A linear
 line in the periphery of the right upper lung is felt to represent artifact.
