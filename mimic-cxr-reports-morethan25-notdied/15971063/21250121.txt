                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Left pneumothorax status post chest tube placement and removal.  New
 pleural effusion postop ___, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Compared to the prior study, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen
 is increased retrocardiac density and hazy opacity at the left base, with
 minimal atelectasis at the right base.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette
 appears unchanged.  
 
 An ET tube tip is not well seen, but appears to lie approximately 6.1 cm above
 the carina.  An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm, off
 the film.  A left-sided PICC line is present, tip over proximal SVC.
