                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left chest tube, evaluate for pneumothorax or hemothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph on ___ at 03:59.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube ends 5 cm from the carina.  An enteric tube
 ends off the imaged portion of the screen.  Left-sided chest tube has been
 placed and subsequently advanced on subsequent images on this study.  The left
 lower lobe opacity is again seen, which is more apparent compared to prior
 study and likely represents a component of aspiration or pneumonia.  There may
 also be a small right pleural effusion.  Tiny left apical pneumothorax.  There
 is some subcutaneous emphysema on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacification in the left lower lung consistent with
 aspiration or pneumonia.  Likely small left pleural effusion.
 
 Tiny left apical pneumothorax.  Left chest tube is in place.
