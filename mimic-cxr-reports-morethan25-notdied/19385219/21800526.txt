 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 10:37 PM
  Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates moderate pulmonary edema with
  cardiomegaly and bilateral airspace opacities and vascular engorgement. 
  Blunting of bilateral costophrenic angles, right greater than left, reflects
  likely pleural effusions.  There is opacification within the medial right
  lower lung zone worrisome for pneumonia.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis, bacteremia, volume overload on 3L
 // assess for pulm edema      assess for pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  There no prior chest radiographs available for review.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Sharply marginated opacification at the right lung base is probably collapsed
 right lower lobe.  Accompanying right pleural effusion is moderate size. 
 Right hilus is largely obscured.  Mild edema is present in the left lung.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  There is no appreciable left pleural effusion and
 no pneumothorax.
