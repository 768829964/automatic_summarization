 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cirrhosis, pleural effusions now new O2
 requirement.  // new focal infiltrates?      new focal infiltrates?
 
 COMPARISON:  PRIOR CHEST RADIOGRAPHS ___ THROUGH ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since ___ following removal of the right basal pigtail pleural drainage
 catheter the large right pleural effusion has increased.  Nevertheless there
