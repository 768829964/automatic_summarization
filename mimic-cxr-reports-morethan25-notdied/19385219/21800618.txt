                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p right chest tube removal  // ? ptx, effusion,
 consolidation      ? ptx, effusion, consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 03:36
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi supine chest radiograph ___ at 15:53 is submitted
 for interpretation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube continues to have its tip 4 cm above the carina.  The right
 internal jugular central line is unchanged in position.  Interval removal of
 the right basilar pleural pigtail catheter. No pneumothorax, although the
 sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi-supine technique. 
 There is a residual stable basilar loculated pleural effusion and persistent
 airspace opacity at the right base which may reflect atelectasis, although
 superimposed infection cannot be excluded. Although lung volumes remain low,
 the left lung is grossly clear.  There is crowding of the pulmonary
 vasculature but no overt pulmonary edema is evident.
