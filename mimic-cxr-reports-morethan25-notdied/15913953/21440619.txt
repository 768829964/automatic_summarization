  1.  Interval placement of a tracheostomy tube, an unremarkable position.  No
  pneumothorax.
  
  2.  Right internal jugular central venous line ends in the low SVC.
  
  3.  Opacification of the left hemithorax has decreased over the interval. 
  This most likely represents a combination of atelectasis and pleural effusion.
