                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CP and chronic trach, with new hypotension
 // eval for new consolidation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube is in-situ, with the tip abutting the tracheal wall.  A
 right-sided subclavian Port-A-Cath terminates in the mid SVC.  A left-sided
 internal jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC.  Lung volumes are
 very low with significant bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.  This results in
 crowding of the pulmonary bronchovascular structures limiting assessment.  No
 worsening consolidation seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube is in-situ, with the tip abutting the tracheal wall.
 
 Lung volumes are very low with significant bilateral lower lobe atelectasis.
