                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure s/p trach and now
 worsening hypoxia.  // Please evaluate for consolidation, collapse, effusion,
 and interval change.      Please evaluate for consolidation, collapse,
 effusion, and interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the increased opacification in the
 right upper zone has substantially cleared.  This could reflect previous
 aspiration or possibly even re-expansion of a collapsed upper lobe.
 The monitoring and support devices are unchanged.  Opacification along the
 right lateral chest wall and hazy opacification at the bases consistent with
 pleural effusion on this side.  Mild opacification at the left base is
 consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe.  No convincing evidence of
 pulmonary vascular congestion.
