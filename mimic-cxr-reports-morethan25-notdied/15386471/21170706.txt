                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CP chronic trach, high peak airway
 pressures  // eval for edema, pna
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph of 2 days earlier, the right hemi thorax is
 now nearly completely opacified.  This appears to be due to a combination of
 enlarging right pleural effusion and substantial collapse of the right middle
 and right lower lobes as well as partial atelectasis of the right upper lobe. 
 Other pre-existing findings appear unchanged.
