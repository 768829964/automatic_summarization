 Tracheostomy is in place.  Port-A-Cath catheter tip is at the level of
 cavoatrial junction.  Large bilateral pleural effusions appear to be increased

 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 Substantial increase in a adjacent consolidation might reflect atelectasis or
 progression of pneumonia.
