                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with cerebral palsy on chronic ventilation,
 admitted w/ UTI  // confirm port placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube is in-situ.  A right-sided subclavian Port-A-Cath
 terminates in the mid SVC.  A left-sided internal jugular catheter terminates
 in the proximal SVC.  Lung volumes are low with bilateral lower lobe
 atelectasis.  This results in crowding of the pulmonary bronchovascular
 structures limiting assessment.  No definite consolidation seen.  No definite
 pleural effusion seen.
