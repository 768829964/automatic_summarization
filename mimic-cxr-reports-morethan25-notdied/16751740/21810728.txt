                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  Status post bronchoscopy.  ___-year-old male patient with right
 middle cerebral aneurysm, subarachnoid hematoma, status post coiling,
 postoperative course complicated by worsening subarachnoid hematoma, status
 post bronchoscopy.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made to the next preceding similar study
 obtained two hours earlier during the same day.  The patient remained
 intubated, the ETT in unchanged position.  The same holds for the previously
 described left subclavian approach central venous line.  Heart size is
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax has developed.  A new parenchymal density exists
 now in the right upper lobe area with typical concave contours indicating
 atelectasis.  The minor fissure is mildly elevated, but as it leaves a
 triangular-shaped free segment, it is noted that the atelectasis appears to be
 limited to the apical segment of the right upper lobe.  Otherwise, no new
 pulmonary abnormalities with the exception of a small peripheral plate
 atelectasis in the left lower lobe laterally.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Development of sizeable upper lobe apical segment atelectasis
 since next preceding portable chest examination.  No pneumothorax.
 
 The referring physician, ___. ___, was paged at 3:50 p.m.
