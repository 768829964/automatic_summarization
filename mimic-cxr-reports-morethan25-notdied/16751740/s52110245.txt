                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with subarachnoid
 hemorrhage and right lower lobe consolidation.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.  
 
 The ET tube tip is 7 cm above the carina.  The left subclavian line tip is at
 the level of mid SVC.  There is interval increase in the right lower lobe
 consolidation, but interval improvement of the left lower lobe consolidation,
 finding consistent most likely with right lower lobe pneumonia, potentially
 resolved left lower lobe aspiration.  No pneumothorax is seen.
