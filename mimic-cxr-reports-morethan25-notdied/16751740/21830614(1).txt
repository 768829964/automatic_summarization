 placement of ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 7.6 cm above the carinal.  The
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.  Lungs are well
 expanded and clear.  There is no focal consolidation, pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Minimal linear atelectasis or scar is present at the left lung
 base
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 7.6 cm above the carina, for which
 advancement by a few cm may be helpful for standard positioning.
