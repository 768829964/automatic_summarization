                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Right MCA subarachnoid hemorrhage, status post coiling. 
 Postoperative course complicated by worsening subarachnoid hemorrhage and
 desaturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 4:51 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal radiographs of the chest were acquired.  The endotracheal
 tube ends 6.8 cm above the level of the carina, slightly high.  A left
 subclavian central venous catheter ends in the mid SVC.  An enteric catheter
 courses below the level of the diaphragm and out of the field of view
 inferiorly.  Heterogeneous opacities at the right lung base are slightly
 increased, consistent with aspiration pneumonitis versus infection.  Left
 retrocardiac atelectasis is not significantly changed.  Heterogenous opacities
 along the lateral aspect of the left lower lung are concerning for pneumonia
 or aspiration pneumonitis.  The heart size is normal.  The mediastinal
 contours are normal.  There are no pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Slight increase in heterogeneous right lower lung lobe opacity, in keeping
 with suspected aspiration pneumonitis versus infection.  Similar appearing
 opacities along the lateral aspect of the left lower lobe, possibly aspiration
 pneumonitis versus pneumonia.
 
 2.  Unchanged left retrocardiac atelectasis.
 
 3.  High positioning of the endotracheal tube.  Recommend advancing by 1-cm.
