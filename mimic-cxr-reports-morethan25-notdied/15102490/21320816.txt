                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cerebral hemorrhage, pre-angiogram evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Status post sternotomy and sternal wire.  Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
 in situ.  Minimal atelectasis at the left lung bases and in the retrocardiac
 lung areas as well as in the middle lobe.  Longstanding relative hyperlucency
 of the right lung apex could suggest presence of right upper lobe pulmonary
 emphysema.  No evidence of pneumonia.  No pleural effusions.
