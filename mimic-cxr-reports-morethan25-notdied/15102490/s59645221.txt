                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of endocarditis and a mycotic
 aneurysm on current treatment for pneumonia, evaluate for persistent
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Portable chest radiograph ___.
 
 SINGLE PORTABLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Tracheostomy is in place.  A
 left-sided pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle is noted.  A right-sided PICC line is present with its tip
 terminating in the mid to distal SVC.  A presumed shunt catheter is seen
 traversing the right neck, chest and upper abdomen.  Sternotomy wires and
 valvuloplasty are noted.
 
 A retrocardiac opacity unchanged and likely represents persistent left lower
 lobe collapse.  Patchy atelectasis at the right lung base appears improved
 since prior study.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The heart
 size is unchanged and normal.  The mediastinal silhouette is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left lower lobe collapse with mild improvement in the
 previously seen bibasilar atelectasis, however, infection cannot be fully
 excluded.
