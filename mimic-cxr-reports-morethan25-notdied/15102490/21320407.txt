 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  SAH, history of mycotic aneurysm.  Intubated patient.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 NG tube tip is in the stomach, is coiled, and the tip is at the fundus.  ET
 tube is in standard position.  Spacer leads are in standard position with tips
 in the right atrium and right ventricle.  There is no evident pneumothorax. 
 Patient has known emphysema.  Bibasilar opacities have increased on the left. 
 These are probably due to increasing atelectasis, but aspiration cannot be
 excluded.  There is no pleural effusion.  Cardiac size is normal.
