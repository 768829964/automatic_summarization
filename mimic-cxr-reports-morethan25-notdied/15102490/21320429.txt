 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with tracheostomy and desaturation. 
 Evaluate for acute process.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a tracheostomy tube whose distal tip is at the level of
 the aortic knob.  There is a dual-lead left-sided pacemaker with tips in the
 right atrium and right ventricle.  There is a right-sided central venous
 catheter with distal lead tip in the distal SVC.  The cardiac silhouette and
 mediastinum are within normal limits.  There is atelectasis at both lung bases
 which is stable.  There is a small left-sided pleural effusion.  The right CP
