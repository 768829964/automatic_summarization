                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:    ___M with s/p intubated eval for ett pl;acement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There are bibasilar opacities, more confluent on the left than on the right
 with silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm.  These could be in part due to
 atelectasis in the setting of low lung volumes although, particularly on the
 left, there may be superimposed effusion or infection.  Superiorly, the lungs
 are clear.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits. 
 Prosthetic valve and median sternotomy wires are noted.  Left chest wall dual
 lead pacing device is seen.  Additional catheter projects over the right chest
 an into the abdomen without discontinuity where seen.  No displaced fractures.
