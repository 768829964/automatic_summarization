                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Tracheostomy tube tip is 6.8 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip is out of view,
 can be followed to the level of the hemidiaphragm.  There has been interval
 improvement in aeration of the right lung with improving collapse. 
 Cardiomediastinum is less shifted towards the right.  Moderate pulmonary edema
 is unchanged.  Bilateral pleural effusion that are moderate, right greater
 than left, are grossly unchanged allowing the difference in technique and
 positioning of the patient.  Right PICC tip is in the upper SVC.
