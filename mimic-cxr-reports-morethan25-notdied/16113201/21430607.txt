                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Sepsis, assessment of the volume status.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest
 
 The ET tube tip is high, 7.3 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is in the
 stomach.  Left internal jugular line tip is at the junction of the
 brachiocephalic vein and SVC.  There is continued atelectasis of the right mid
 and lower lobe, as previously seen already on CT from ___.  As
 compared to most recent prior study, there is slight interval progression of
 the left lower lung consolidation with unchanged appearance of the left upper
 lobe opacity.  Bilateral pleural effusions are most likely present but the
 lung bases are not included in the field-of-view.
