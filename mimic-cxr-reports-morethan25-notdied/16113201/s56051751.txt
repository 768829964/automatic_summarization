                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ARDS, collapsed lung, pneumonia.  Is lung still collapsed?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 3:28.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube, NG tube and left internal jugular catheter in unchanged
 satisfactory position. It is somewhat difficult to compare to prior radiograph
 due to differences in rotation; however, there does not appear to be any
 significant change  in complete collapse of right lower lobe and likely
 partial atelectasis of the right middle lobe. Moderate right effusion is also
 unchanged. Multifocal consolidation in left lung is similar to recent CXR
 except for apparent slight worsening in left lower lung. No pneumothorax is
 identified.
