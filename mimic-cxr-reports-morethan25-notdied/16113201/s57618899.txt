                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 1:37 P.M., ___  
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with respiratory failure.  Check ET tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 12:25 a.m.:
 
 ET tube is in standard placement, tip approximately 4 to 5 cm above the
 carina.  Consolidation is worsening in both lungs and there is more
 mediastinal vascular engorgement.  Interval change is presumably due to
 cardiac decompensation, but concurrent pneumonia is presumed, particularly in
 the left lung and may be worsening on the right as well.
