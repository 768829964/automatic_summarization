                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, radiation related to the
 size of the patient again greatly obscures detail.  The monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  Again there is enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette, which is somewhat displaced to the right, bilateral pleural
 effusions, lower lobe atelectasis on the right, and probably elevation in
 pulmonary venous pressure.
