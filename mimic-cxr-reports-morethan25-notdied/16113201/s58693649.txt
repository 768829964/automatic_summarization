                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with ARDS, status post OG tube placement, to
 confirm placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph done earlier today at 2:38.
 
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A nasogastric tube tip is in the
 proximal stomach with the sideholes positioned at or just below the level of
 the gastroesophageal junction. Endotracheal tube and left internal jugular
 approach central venous catheter are unchanged in position.  Heterogeneous
 opacification of the entire left lung and atelectasis of the right lower lobe,
 is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Nasogastric tube needs to be advanced further as the side holes
 are at the level of the gastroesophageal junction.
