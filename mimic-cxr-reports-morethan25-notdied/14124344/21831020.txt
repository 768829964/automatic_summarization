  1.  Decreased bilateral pleural effusions with small right layering effusion. 
  No new pneumonia.
  2. Slightly twisted tracheostomy.  Additional support lines and tubes as
  described above.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 6:29 AM
  1. Findings worrisome for left anterior pneumothorax. Consider right lateral
  decubitus radiographs for further evaluation.
  2. Persistent right upper and mid lung opacity likely represents atelectasis
  however differential includes pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
  3. Support lines and tubes as described above.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___M intubated. Assess for cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a right PICC tip
 within the mid SVC, unchanged from previous examination. Tracheostomy is
 slightly twisted within the mid trachea. A gastrojejunostomy tube is stable in
 appearance within the left upper quadrant. Aspirated barium is again seen in
 the right lower lobe.
 
 Persistently hypoinflated lungs.  Near-complete resolution of bilateral
 pleural effusions with persistent small layering right pleural effusion. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis noted.  Heart size, mediastinal contour, and hila are
 unremarkable.
 
 Limited assessment of the osseous structures are unremarkable and upper
 abdomen is within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Decreased bilateral pleural effusions with small right layering effusion.
 No new pneumonia.
 2.  Slightly twisted tracheostomy.  Additional support lines and tubes as
 described above.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Updated findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with
 primary team on the telephone on ___ at 6:25 AM, 5 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
