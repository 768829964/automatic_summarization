                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:   ___M with cough, leukocytosis  // acute cardiopulm
 diseaseHematoma on physical exam, trauma.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest demonstrated hyperexpanded lungs.
 Increased pleural-based density at the right base posteriorly may represent a
 partially loculated hemorrhagic right-sided pleural effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.  No pneumothorax. 
 Increased soft tissue density seen in the posterior soft tissues adjacent to
 the pleural based abnormality on the lateral view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased pleural-based density at the right base.  This may represent a
 partially loculated hemothorax in the setting of recent trauma. Recommend CT
 of the chest for additional evaluation.
