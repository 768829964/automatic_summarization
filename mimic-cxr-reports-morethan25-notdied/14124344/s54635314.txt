 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with failure to thrive, wt loss and strep
 anginosus abscesses s/p intubation for bronch  // ETT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 2:54 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The
 tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5 cm above the carinal.  Of the
 intubation, the lung volumes have increased.  The 2 right pleural drains are
 in unchanged position.  2 new hyperlucent lines paralleling the right chest
 wall are likely caused by skin folds. However, these structures should receive
 attention on followup radiographs, in order to rule out pneumothorax.
 New retrocardiac atelectasis.  Unchanged appearance of the mediastinum.
