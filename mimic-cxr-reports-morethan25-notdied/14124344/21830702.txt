                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o M with recently diagnosed DM2, cachexia with recent
 unexplained ___-lb weight loss admitted from ___ for leukocytosis and
 thrombocytosis, now admitted to the MICU for hypoxia and s/p several
 aspiration events, intubated today.  // Interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube is now at almost
 7 cm distance from the carinal. The tube should be advanced by ___ cm. The
 right lower lobe parenchymal opacity, likely caused by aspiration, is better
 defined than on previous images.  This is likely due to clearing of a
 pre-existing right pleural effusion.  The currently is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  An atelectasis at the left lung bases has decreased in
 severity.
