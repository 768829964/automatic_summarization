                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with anemia hypotension on pressors and
 worsening hypoxia  // ?interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study.  There are persistent
 perihilar airspace opacities, similar in extent when compared to the prior
 study.  Given the rapid development, this likely reflects pulmonary edema. 
 There is left lower lobe atelectasis.  .  No pneumothorax seen.  A right
 internal jugular catheter terminates in the distal SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent bilateral predominate perihilar airspace opacities likely
 reflecting pulmonary edema.  Superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
