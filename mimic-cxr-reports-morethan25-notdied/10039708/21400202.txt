 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 -ET tube terminates 2.9 cm above the carina in grossly appropriate location.
 -Enteric tube courses inferiorly with distal tip projecting over the
 approximate location of the gastric body, with side port seen approximately
 5.3 cm distal to the GE junction.
 -Unchanged appearance of bilateral diffuse airspace opacities, except for
 potential progression of left lower lobe atelectasis giving the left
 mediastinal shift slightly more pronounced than on the prior study.
 -Right-sided central venous line and PICC line are in unchanged position.
