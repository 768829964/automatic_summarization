                                 FINAL REPORT

 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recent intubation for respiratory
 distress.  // interval change?      interval change?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications
 are again seen, with a pattern that is most consistent with substantial
 pulmonary edema.  However, in the appropriate clinical setting, it would be
 difficult to exclude superimposed pneumonia, especially in the absence of a
 lateral view.
