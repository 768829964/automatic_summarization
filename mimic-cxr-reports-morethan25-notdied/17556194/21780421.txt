                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with dl picc and fevers of unknown origin
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable semi upright view of the chest.   Left upper extremity PICC line
 again noted with unchanged position in the distal left brachiocephalic vein.  
 Tracheostomy projects over the superior mediastinum.  Area of partially
 calcified consolidation in the right lower lobe is grossly unchanged better
 assessed on prior CT.  Streaky left lower lobe opacity likely represents
 atelectasis.  Blunting of the right CP angle may indicate a small right
 pleural effusion.  No large pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.  No acute bony abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Findings as above.  No convincing signs of pneumonia.
