                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with hyponatremia.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiographs.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Large, calcific opacity in the right lower lung involving the pleura and
 parenchyma may reflect remote infection, possibly tuberculosis, or prior
 hemothorax.  Superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded.  Heart size is at the
 upper limits of normal and thoracic aorta is enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Calcific opacity in the right lower lung may reflect remote infection or
 hemothorax.  Recommend CT chest to evaluate for superimposed, acute pneumonia.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  CT chest to evaluate for superimposed, acute pneumonia and
 for better characterization of thoracic aortic enlargement.
