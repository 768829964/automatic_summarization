                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with aneurysm bleed, increasing O2
 requirements,  // ?worsening edema      ?worsening edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube tip is 6.6 cm above the carinal.  NG tube tip is in the stomach. 
 Right pigtail catheter is in place.  Widespread parenchymal consolidations are
 re- demonstrated, fluctuating compared to the previous study:  The right mid
 lung consolidation is worse but there is interval improvement of the left
 basal opacity.  The findings might be consistent with parenchymal hemorrhage
 versus asymmetric pulmonary edema.  Aspiration would be less likely.
