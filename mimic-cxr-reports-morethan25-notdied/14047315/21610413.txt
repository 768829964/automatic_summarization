                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SAH, RLL infiltrate, hypoxic, s/p bronch
 ___.  // interval change      interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___:
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Some interval improvement in the widespread consolidation in the left lung
 suggests it could been due in part to recent aspiration or, less likely,
 asymmetric edema.  However severe right lung consolidation persists and there
 is still the suggestion of cavitation.  Lateral aspect of the right lower
 chest is excluded from this study, but at least a small right pleural effusion
 is likely.  There is no pneumothorax.  Heart size is normal.
 
 ET tube, left subclavian line, and esophageal drainage tube ending in the
 stomach are all in standard placements.
