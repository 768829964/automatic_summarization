                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with SAH and pleural effusion  // r/o evolving
 cardiopulmonary process
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___ chest radiograph, asymmetrically distributed
 bilateral airspace opacities involving the left lung to a greater degree than
 the right have worsened in the interval.  Small right apical pneumothorax is
 again demonstrated with right pleural catheter in place.  Moderate left
 pleural effusion and small right pleural effusion appear increased compared to
 the recent radiograph, although positional differences limit comparison
 between the studies.
