 e/o L ACA and AComm aneurysms on CTA, s/p intubation and EVD placement  //
 please eval for interval change     please eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph from ___, 9:55 p.m., there
 is unchanged evidence of a miniscule right-sided pneumothorax.  In the
 interval, this pneumothorax has slightly decreased in extent.  The position of
 the monitoring and support devices, including the pigtail catheter in the
 right pleural space, is unchanged.  Unchanged severity in extent of the
 pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities.  Stable normal size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  The presence of a small left pleural effusion cannot be
 excluded, given that the left costophrenic sinus is blunted.
