                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with fever, hypotension  // presence of infiltrate
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable supine view of the chest.  Limited evaluation due to portable
 technique and rotation. Right IJ dialysis catheter is again seen. Cardiomegaly
 is noted, likely in part magnified due to technique. Dense consolidation in
 the right midlung could reflect pneumonia. Additionally, increased opacity in
 the left perihilar region could reflect pneumonia. Mild to moderate pulmonary
 edema difficult to exclude. Bilateral small pleural effusions likely present.
 Further evaluation is limited due to positioning.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Limited exam with airspace consolidations concerning for pneumonia, small
 pleural effusions, cardiomegaly and probable mild pulmonary edema. A repeat
 study may be performed when patient is more stable to further assess.
