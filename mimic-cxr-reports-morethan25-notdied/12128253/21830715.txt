                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure, s/p tracheostomy  //
 Evaluate for infiltrates, edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tracheostomy is in place. There is substantial pulmonary edema and large hilar
 enlargement that potentially may reflect masses consolidations or vascular
 congestion. Assessment with CT of the chest that was done without
 administration of IV contrast did not reveals any suspicious pathology but
 right upper lobe process concerning for infectious pneumonia was demonstrated.
 Overall since the prior study there is interval progression of both
 consolidations as well as pleural effusions
