 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MSSA bactermia, bilateral chest tubes,
 respiratory failure s/p trach and peg  // eval interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since ___ the increase in a roughly elliptical opacity in the right
 midlung this suggests pleural fluid reaccumulating in the right major fissure,
 despite the right basal pigtail pleural drainage catheter. Moderate
 cardiomegaly is stable. The small residual left pleural effusion is stable,
 with a second probe pigtail pleural drainage catheter in place.  Right lower
 lobe it is persistently atelectatic. Generalized pulmonary vascular congestion
 is unchanged, and there may be new consolidation in the right upper lobe minor
 fissure.
 
 ET tube is in standard placement. Dual channel dialysis catheter extends from
 the right internal jugular to the inferior cavoatrial junction.  Left
 subclavian line ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
