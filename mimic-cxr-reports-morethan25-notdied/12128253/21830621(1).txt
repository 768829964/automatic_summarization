                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with MSSA bacteremia c/b retropharyngeal abscess,
 respiratory failure ___ pna, and epidural abscess  // eval ETT, pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the right chest tube, the endotracheal
 tube and the left internal jugular vein catheter are in constant and correct
 position.  The ventilation of the right lung has improved, with resolution of
 to mild perihilar areas of atelectasis and likely minimal intrafissural fluid
 accumulation.  There is no evidence of a right pneumothorax.  No opacities
 have newly occurred.  Mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema persists.
