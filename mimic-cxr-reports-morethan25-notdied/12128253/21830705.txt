 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 02:46
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 12:13 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube now lies approximately 8 cm above the carina and should be
 advanced approximately 3-4 cm to place the tip at the thoracic inlet.   Right
 internal jugular central line and left internal jugular central line are
 unchanged in position. Right PICC line terminates in the mid axillary region.
 There are layering bilateral effusions, left much greater than right. There is
 persistent consolidation in the retrocardiac region as well as patchy opacity
 at the right base which would be consistent with partial lower lobe
 atelectasis, although superimposed pneumonia cannot be excluded. Mild
 pulmonary edema has improved. Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable. .
 
 NOTIFICATION:  The patient's nurse, ___, was notified by phone of the need to
