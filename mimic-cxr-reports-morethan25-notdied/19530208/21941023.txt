 cm from the carina.  Right brachiocephalic/SVC stent is unchanged in position.
 Bilateral parenchymal opacities are again seen, slighly decreased on the left.
 Possibly trace pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Enteric tube ends off the inferior portion of the image.  Slight
