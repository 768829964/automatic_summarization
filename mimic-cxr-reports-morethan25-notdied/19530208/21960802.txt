                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman who is intubated with hypotension  // edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable, semi upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ETT in standard position.  Overlapping vascular stents projecting over the
 right upper medial hemithorax are unchanged.  Enteric tube tip and sideport
 projecting over the expected region of the stomach in left upper quadrant. 
 Hemodialysis catheter tip projects over the lower right mediastinum,
 unchanged.
 
 Lung volumes remain low.  Bilateral lower lobe streaky linear opacities are
 most consistent with atelectasis, increased from prior exam, now with
 indistinct left hemidiaphragm and descending aorta borders.  No pneumothorax,
 edema or effusion.  The heart size normal.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval decreased lung volumes and increased atelectasis.
