                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with history of VAP
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph and ___ chest CT
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  Tracheostomy tube,
 right PICC, and right sided central venous catheter all remain in unchanged
 positions. An enteric tube is seen with tip in the region of the stomach.
 Heart size remains mildly to moderately enlarged. Extensive atherosclerotic
 calcifications are seen throughout the aorta with widening of the superior
 mediastinum which could reflect a combination of the patient's known
 descending thoracic aortic aneurysm as well as loculated fluid along the
 apices bilaterally. Low lung volumes are present with mild pulmonary edema.
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are noted. Patchy opacities in lung bases
 may reflect areas of atelectasis though infection cannot be completely
 excluded. More focal opacity within the right mid lung field is also similar.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions.  Opacities in the
 lung bases as well as within the right mid lung field are similar and may
 reflect areas of atelectasis and/or infection.
