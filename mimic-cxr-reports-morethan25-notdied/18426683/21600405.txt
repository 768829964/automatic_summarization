                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CABG // eval for ptx s/p CT removal
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph performed yesterday morning, the bilateral chest
 tubes have been removed.  The enteric tube terminates in the stomach. Right IJ
 introducer and left subclavian line terminates at the mid-SVC. Endotracheal
 tube is 6.4 cm above the carina. Median sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 There is some persistent layering pleural effusions bilaterally. Bibasilar
 atelectasis also noted.  No pneumothorax. Right paramediastinal opacity
 described on the ___ CXR is re-demonstrated, and the possibility of a
 mediastinal hematoma should be considered. Persistent cardiomegaly.
 Atherosclerotic calcifications are noted in the aortic arch.  Some surgical
 clips are noted in the left upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval removal of bilateral chest tubes. No pneumothorax.
 2. ETT is 6.4cm above the carina.
 3. Persistent right paramediastinal opacity, which may represent a mediastinal
 hematoma. Close attention on follow-up.
