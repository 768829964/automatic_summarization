                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with s/p CABG w/ hypoxemia  // eval pneumonia    
 eval pneumonia
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  The right hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen. 
 Although this could be a manifestation of decreasing pleural effusion, more
 likely reflects a more upright position of the patient. Retrocardiac
 opacification process, consistent with volume loss in left lower lobe and
 pleural fluid.  There is an area of increased opacification on a horizontally
 in the right mid zone. This could represent pleural fluid within the minor
 fissure.
