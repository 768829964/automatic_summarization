                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  IPH, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 4:04 a.m.
 
 There are very low inspiratory volumes. The carina is not well defined on
 these films.  Allowing for this, the ET tube is quite low lying -- it appears
 to be at the carina, pointing toward the right mainstem  bronchus. 
 
 Prominence of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is likely accentuated by low
 inspiratory volumes.  There is patchy opacity at both bases, also likely
 accentuated by low lung volumes.  Possible small effusions cannot be excluded.
 Doubt CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Low inspiratory volumes.  
 2) Note is made of low lying ET tube.  Clinical correlation regarding
 retraction is requested, as it does appear to be directly at the level of the
 carina, pointing toward the right mainstem bronchus.
 
 ETT findings discussed with Dr. ___ at 12:31 am on ___ (___,
 phone).
