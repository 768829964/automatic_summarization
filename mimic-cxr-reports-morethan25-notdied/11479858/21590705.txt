                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:04 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with IPH intubated.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 With the chin elevated, tip of the endotracheal tube, no more than 15 mm above
 the carina is below optimal placement and it should be withdrawn 2.5 cm at
 least.  Lung volumes remain quite low and there is substantial bibasilar
 atelectasis, worse today than yesterday.  Upper lungs are grossly clear,
 pleural effusions are small, if any.  Heart size is top normal, exaggerated by
 low lung volumes also responsible in part for apparent widening of the upper
 mediastinum, though I believe that mediastinal veins are dilated.  No
 pneumothorax is present.
