                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:48 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Left basal ganglia hemorrhage, pneumonia on CT.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 There is a suggestion of new consolidation at the right lung base medially,
 which could be pneumonia.  Vascular congestion in the lungs and mediastinal
 veins and a slight increase in mild cardiomegaly reflect cardiac dysfunction,
 though there is no pulmonary edema or appreciable pleural effusion.  ET tube
 is in standard position, upper enteric feeding tube passes to the upper
 stomach.  No pneumothorax.
