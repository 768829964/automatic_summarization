                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Basal ganglia hemorrhage after hemicraniectomy and
 currently with fevers.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Tracheostomy is in place with the tip being 2.3 cm above the carina.  Right
 PICC line tip is at the level of cavoatrial junction.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unremarkable.  The lung volumes are low with the minimal area
 of atelectasis bilaterally.  No definitive evidence of infection is seen,
 although left lower lobe opacity might reflect developing infection or  
 atelectasis.
