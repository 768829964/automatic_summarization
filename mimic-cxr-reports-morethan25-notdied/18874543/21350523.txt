                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  PICC line assessment.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the guidewire has been
 withdrawn and, as a consequence, line is more difficult to visualize. 
 However, the tip of the line projects over the lower SVC, it appears as if the
 catheter would have been pulled back by approximately 1 to 2 cm in the
 interval.  There is no evidence of kinking of the catheter.  Normal catheter
 course.  No major changes in the appearance of the lung parenchyma, in
 particular of the known mild retrocardiac and left perihilar parenchymal
 opacities.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
