                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia and respiratory failure with brain abscesses. 
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications are again
 seen which could reflect pulmonary edema and pleural effusions with
 compressive atelectasis with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe. 
 In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would have to be
 seriously considered.
