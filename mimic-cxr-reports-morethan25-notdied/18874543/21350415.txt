                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with intubation, pneumonia, brain lesion?.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends at the carina and has to be pulled back at least 3 cm.  Right
 lower lung consolidation due to aspiration or atelectasis has slightly
 improved.  Left lower lung consolidation is unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are
 normal.  NG tube is in the stomach.  Left subclavian line is in adequate
 position.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  ET tube ends at the carina and has to be pulled back.
 2.  Right lower lung consolidation has slightly improved.  Left lower lung
 consolidation is unchanged.  This is presumed to be due to aspiration or
 atelectasis.
 
 This was discussed with the medical team.
