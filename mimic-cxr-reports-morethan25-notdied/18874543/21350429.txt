                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  NG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, last performed on ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest performed at
 13:31 on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Evaluation is slightly limited due to patient rotation and low
 inspiratory lung volumes.  The cardiac silhouette size is top normal.  Mild
 widening of the mediastinum is stable and likely related to vessel
 engorgement.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema is
 unchanged.  Bibasilar opacities on the left greater than the right are
 slightly improved from the most recent prior study, possibly reflecting
 atelectasis.  A small left pleural effusion cannot be entirely excluded.  No
 significant right pleural effusion is detected.  An endotracheal tube is in
 standard position.  A right PICC line is unchanged with the tip terminating in
 the mid-to-low SVC.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm
 and out of view on this image.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved bibasilar atelectasis on the left greater than the right.
 2.  Stable mild pulmonary vascular congestion/edema.
 3.  Appropriate position of lines and tubes.
