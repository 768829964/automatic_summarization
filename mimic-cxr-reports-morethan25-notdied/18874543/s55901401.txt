 WET READ: ___ ___ 9:09 PM
  In comparison to the prior study from ___, there is a new right lower lobe
  opacity, likely representative of atelectasis or aspiration; however,
  pneumonia must be excluded in the proper clinical setting. Otherwise, little
  change with low lung volumes accentuating heart size, persistent left lower
  lobe consolidation, and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  Et tube in lower
  trachea, enteric tube in stomach, left subclavian central line with tip in
  upper svc.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with pneumonia, aspiration, intubated worsening
 saturation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is rotated towards the right.  ET tube ends 1.8 cm above the
 carina.  Left subclavian vein is at the junction of brachiocephalic vein and
 superior vena cava.  Right lower lung consolidation is new compatible with
 aspiration or atelectasis.  Left lower lung opacities are hard to compare due
 to the rotation of the patient.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Right lower lung consolidation is new worrisome for aspiration or
 atelectasis.
 2.  Left lower lung consolidation is hard to compare due to the position of
 the patient.  This is probably from aspiration too.
