                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Fall.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is in a standard position.  NG tube tip is out of view,
 below the diaphragm.  Left PICC tip is in the mid SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  If any, there is a small left pleural effusion.  Mild
 cardiomegaly is stable.  Right lower lobe opacities have increased, worrisome
 for aspiration.  There is mild vascular congestion.  Spinal hardware is again
 noted.
