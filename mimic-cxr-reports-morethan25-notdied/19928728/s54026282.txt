                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman status post fall with first rib fracture, now
 intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiographs and CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable supine chest radiograph is obtained. 
 Endotracheal tube ends in the mid airway.  An enteric tube projects over the
 stomach.  The lungs are well inflated.  Blunting of the bilateral costophrenic
 angles suggests small bilateral effusions.  Aeration of the lungs has mildly
 improved.  Airspace opacities remain in the right lower lobe.  Sclerotic
 changes of the left humerus is unchanged.  A nondisplaced right first rib
 fracture noted on CT is not seen on radiography.  Lower thoracic vertebral
 compression fractures are again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Focal opacity in the right lower lobe may be atelectasis or developing
 consolidation.  Suggest attention on follow up radiography.
