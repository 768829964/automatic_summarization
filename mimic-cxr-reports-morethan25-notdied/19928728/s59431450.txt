 is a left-sided PICC line whose distal tip is in the mid SVC and is oblique to
 the SVC wall.  There is a feeding tube whose distal tip and side port are
 below the gastroesophageal junction.  Heart size is enlarged.  There is
 prominence of the pulmonary interstitial markings suggestive of minimal fluid
