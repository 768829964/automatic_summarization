                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with NSCLC s/p upper lobectomy, reduction, and
 LMSB stenting, now with post-obstructive PNA  // ? interval changes,
 effusions, obstruction     ? interval changes, effusions, obstruction
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The left bronchial stent is grossly patent and has not migrated since ___.  Nevertheless consolidation in the left lower lobe has worsened,
 presumably pneumonia.  There has also been an increase in heterogeneous
 opacification in the right Lung which could be due to a second focus of
 pneumonia, spreading from the left lower lung.  No pneumothorax.  Right
 pleural scarring is chronic, not an effusion.  Interval increase in heart size
 is due at least to the  change from PA to AP radiographic orientation.
