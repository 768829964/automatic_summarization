                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Combined consolidation and atelectasis within the lingula has
 minimally improved as evidenced by new visualization of a small portion of the
 left heart border.  However, an adjacent area of opacity at the left lung base
 has slightly worsened. Bilateral upper lobe predominant emphysema is again
 demonstrated.  Volume loss and architectural distortion in the right lung are
 consistent with previous right upper lobe lobectomy changes with some
 associated pleural and parenchymal scarring.
