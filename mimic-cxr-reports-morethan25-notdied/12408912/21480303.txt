 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:29 PM
  An endotracheal tube may terminate in the very proximal right mainstem
  bronchus and should be pulled back.  Cardiomegaly is mild. An enteric tube
  courses below the level of the diaphragm and terminates in the region of the
  stomach.  There is mild pulmonary edema.  Atelectasis is noted at the left
  lung base.  A left mainstem bronchial stent is in stable position.  An opacity
  in the left mid lung is worrisome for a focal consolidation.
  
   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on ___
  at 9:27 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure  // cause of respiratory
 failure      cause of respiratory failure
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comparison to ___.  The patient is intubated, the tip of the
 endotracheal tube projects 2 cm above the carina, the tube should be slightly
 pulled back, by about 1-2 cm.  The stent in the left main bronchus is
 unchanged.  Increasing left perihilar and basal opacities, associated with
 volume loss, and highly suspicious for pneumonia or aspiration.  The right
 lung appears normal.  No pneumothorax.  No larger pleural effusions.
