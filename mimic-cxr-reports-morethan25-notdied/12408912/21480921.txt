  of the left lung apex.  There is still significant opacification involving a
  majority of the left hemithorax, with associated leftward mediastinal shift.

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs since ___, most recently ___ at 05:22.
 
 ET tube has not been advanced at least 4 cm, as previously suggested.
 
 New interstitial abnormality in the right lower lung is probably edema. 
 Minimal aeration has returned the apex of the left lung, still otherwise
 collapsed.  Bronchial stent is still present in the left main and lower lobe
