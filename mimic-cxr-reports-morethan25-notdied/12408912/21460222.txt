                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Post-obstructive pneumonia, history of lung cancer.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  Reference also made to chest CT from ___.
 
 The patient is status post right upper lobectomy.  There is again evidence of
 left upper lobe collapse seen on CT secondary to known obstructing left
 juxta-hilar mass.  Patchy left basilar retrocardiac opacity may relate to the
 left upper lobe collapse, although underlying consolidation is difficult to
 exclude on this study.  There is minimal blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle again seen.  The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess due to the
 overlying opacity from the left upper lobe collapse, although grossly cardiac
 and mediastinal silhouettes are stable from the prior study.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.
