 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 3:53 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube is at the appropriate level, but the tip abuts the tracheal wall due
 to severe leftward displacement of the cervical trachea by large right goiter.
 Feeding tube in standard placement.  Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is
 chronic.  There is no pulmonary edema and pleural effusion if any is small. 
 Heterogeneous opacification at the lung bases is more likely atelectasis than
 pneumonia.  No pneumothorax.
