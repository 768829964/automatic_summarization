                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pna/ intubated  // interval change     
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ impression:
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic.  Lungs are essentially clear aside from mild
 bibasilar atelectasis.  I do not see evidence of pneumonia on chest imaging
 over the past 12 days.  Small left pleural effusion is new or newly apparent. 
 Previous pulmonary vascular engorgement and suggestion of mild edema on prior
 chest CT are no longer present.
 Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  An endotracheal tube
 ends at the upper margin of the clavicles, no less than 7 cm from the carina. 
 Standard placement is a usually between 4 and 5 cm from the carina, but that
 positioning may be difficult in the setting this patient's large goiter.
