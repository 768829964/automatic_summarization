                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p lobectomy with respiratory failure, intubated
 // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT remains low but unchanged, 1.5 cm above the carina with complete neck
 flexion.  There is an NG tube coursing below the diaphragm, however the tip is
 not visualized on this image.
 
 The diffuse airspace opacity is unchanged on the left.  There is increased
 airspace opacity at the right base.  The right apical pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  Heart size is stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.  No pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. ET tube remains low with complete neck flexion.
 2. NG tube in appropriate position.
 3. Increasing airspace opacity at right base with unchanged airspace opacities
 diffusely throughout left lung, likely alveolar pulmonary edema.
 4. Unchanged right apical pleural effusion.
