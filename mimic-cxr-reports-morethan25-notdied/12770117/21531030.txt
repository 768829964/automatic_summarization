 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tracheostomy tip is low, terminating approximately 1.2 cm above the carina and
 should be pulled back for at least 2 cm.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged including cardiomegaly and mediastinal widening.  Bibasal
 consolidations are unchanged consistent with known ARDS.  Apical cap in the
 right apex is similar to previous examination potentially representing
 increased pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
