                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man POD ___ s/p right upper lobectomy with increasing
 opacificaions of left lung  // assess for interval change     assess for
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 09:02
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 15:27 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 There continues to be a stable diffuse airspace process within the left lung
 and to a lesser extent in the right lower lung.  Findings may reflect
 asymmetric pulmonary edema in this patient status post right upper lobectomy,
 although pneumonia should also be considered.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely unchanged given differences in patient positioning. 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip 3 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen
 coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.  Minimal residual
 right lateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema. No pneumothorax appreciated.
