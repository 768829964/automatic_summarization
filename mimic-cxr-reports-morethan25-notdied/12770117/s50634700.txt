 assess for interval change      assess for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Small right pleural effusion at the apex of the

 appreciable right pleural effusion elsewhere, with a basal pigtail pleural
 drainage catheter still in place.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Moderate to severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality worse in the left lung
 has not changed for several days.  Stability is suggestive of noncardiogenic
 pulmonary edema.
 
 Face mask projects over the tracheostomy tube making it impossible to assess
 the size of the cuff.  Right jugular catheter ends at the origin of the SVC. 
 Left subclavian line ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.
