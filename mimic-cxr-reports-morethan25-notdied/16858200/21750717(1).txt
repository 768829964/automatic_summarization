                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dropping sats after descending aorta replacement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the endotracheal tube and
 nasogastric tube have been removed.  Swan-Ganz catheter and chest tube remain
 in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vascular
 congestion has reduced.  The right effusion is less prominent, as are the
 atelectatic changes at the right base.  Opacification at the left base has
 increased, suggesting pleural fluid and atelectasis in this region.
