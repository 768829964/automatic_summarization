 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 17:07
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with the descending aortic repair Dobbhoff
 tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study ___ at 16:44.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 17:07 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobhoff feeding tube has now been advanced into the stomach.  The left
 subclavian central line is unchanged in position.  Stable postoperative
 appearance to the cardiac and mediastinal contours in this patient status post
 descending aortic repair.  The lungs continue to have bilateral airspace
 process which has improved and therefore likely reflects resolving but
 persistent mild pulmonary edema.  Retrocardiac consolidation likely reflects
 compressive atelectasis in the setting of a small layering effusion, although
 pneumonia in this area cannot be entirely excluded.  No pneumothorax.
