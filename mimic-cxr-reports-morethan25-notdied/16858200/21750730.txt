                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Descending aortic repair.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___ and chest
 CT from ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube terminates 5.6 cm above the
 carina. A Dobbhoff feeding tube terminates within the stomach. A left-sided
 subclavian line terminates at the mid SVC.  Bibasilar patchy opacities and a
 small left pleural effusion are unchanged since ___.  There is
 mild superimposed pulmonary edema which has improved.  Previously seen small
 left apical pneumothorax is no longer present. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Improved mild interstitial edema.
 2.  Unchanged bibasilar atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.
 3.  Resolution of small left apical pneumothorax.
