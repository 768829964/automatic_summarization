                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Post descending aorta repair, post bronch.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs available from ___:31 a.m. and ___.
 
 FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  
 Since the 5:31 a.m. examination, there has been improved aeration of the left
 lower lobe, likely reflecting post-bronchoscopic change.  However an
 underlying flat fluid level raises the suspicion for possible superimposed
 pneumo/hydro-thorax. There remains severe left lower lobe atelectasis.  
 
 The cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged.  The endotracheal tube,
 orogastric tube, and left subclavian lines are unchanged in position.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  A small left pleural effusion is again seen.  There is
 central pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of the left lower lobe, post bronch. Underlying
 flat fluid level raises the suspicion for possible superimposed
 pneumo/hydro-thorax. 
 
 The findings were communicated by Dr. ___ to ___ of Cardiac Surgery
 via telephone at 12:16, ___.
