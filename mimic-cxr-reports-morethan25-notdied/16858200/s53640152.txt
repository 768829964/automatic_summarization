                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Please evaluate Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Dobbhoff tube identified with tip in fundus of stomach.  Normal
 bowel gas pattern.  The incompletely visualized lung bases demonstrate
 improved aeration with the decreased bibasilar atelectasis and edema though
 interstitial prominence persists, likely combination of residual edema and
 background emphysematous changes.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Dobbhoff tube with tip in stomach could be advanced several centimeters.
 2. Persistent though improved pulmonary edema on background of emphysematous
 change.
