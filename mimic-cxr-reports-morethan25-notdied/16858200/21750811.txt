                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT ___ 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair,
 dropping O2 sats.
 
 Comparison to ___ at ___.
 
 A single portable supine chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position.  There are stable
 cardiac and mediastinal contours in this post-operative patient.  Diffuse
 bilateral interstitial abnormality which is unchanged and is of uncertain
 clinical significance.  Linear opacity at the right base has increased and
 likely reflects subsegmental atelectasis rather than post-inflammatory
 scarring.  There is also increasing opacity in the retrocardiac region which
 may represent patchy atelectasis, although a developing pneumonia should also
 be considered.  No large pneumothorax, although the sensitivity to detect
 pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.
