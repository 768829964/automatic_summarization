                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SEMI-UPRIGHT CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position, and cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Worsening
 left lower lobe retrocardiac opacity is probably due to a combination of
 atelectasis and adjacent pleural effusion.  Small right pleural effusion is
 unchanged, but note is made of worsening atelectasis at right base.
