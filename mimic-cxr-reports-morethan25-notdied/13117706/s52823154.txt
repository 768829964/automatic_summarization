 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has had prior median sternotomy. Sternotomy wires are intact and
 aligned. Moderate cardiomegaly despite the projection is stable.  Diffuse
 airspace opacification of the left lung with associated volume loss is not
 appreciably changed since the study of 1 day prior. Retrocardiac airspace
 opacification is likely due to a combination of atelectasis and pleural
 effusion.
