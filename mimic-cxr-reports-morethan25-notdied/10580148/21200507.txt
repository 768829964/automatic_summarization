                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with VAP  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 23:42
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube is present, tip approximately 3.3 cm above the carina.  An
 NG tube is present, tip overlying the gastric fundus.  Looped tubing overlying
 the right upper abdomen and a portion of what is likely an aortic stent are
 noted.  No free air seen beneath the diaphragms on this semi supine view.
 
 Inspiratory volumes are low.  There is cardiomegaly, which appears slightly
 less pronounced than on the prior film.  There is upper zone redistribution. 
 Again seen is a left base opacity with air bronchograms consistent left lower
 lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Patchy opacity at the right infrahilar
 region is similar, possibly slightly improved.  No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity at again seen at both lung bases, consistent with pneumonic
 infiltrates.  Equivocal minimal improvement the right and question left lung
 base.
 
 Mild upper zone redistribution, without other evidence of CHF.
