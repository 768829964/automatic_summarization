   ET tube terminates at the level of the mid clavicular heads, approximately 8
  cm above the carina. This should be advanced by a at least 1-2 cm, unless the
  neck was in an extended position at the time of imaging.  Enteric tube with
  tip in the stomach but sideport may be above GE junction, not clearly seen due
  to overlying EKG leads. Dense consolidation of the right upper lobe with right
  basilar opacity and increased markings in the left lung are concerning for
  multifocal pneumonia, as seen on the recent chest CTA.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxic respiratory failure, s/p intubation 
 // endotrachial tube placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantial progression of large scale consolidation in the right lung,
 previously perihilar now involving much of the middle and lower lobes.
 Moderate right pleural effusion has increased and left perihilar ground-glass
 opacification is new. Although there is some mild pulmonary edema, the
 interval changes are more typical of progressive infection, consistent with
 the presumptive diagnosis of Legionella pneumonia. The right heart border is
 obscured, but the heart is at least mildly enlarged
 
 Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of view. ET tube in standard
 position.  No pneumothorax
