                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with legionella PNA  // interval change?
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In addition to progressing vascular distention, peribronchial infiltration in
 the left mid and lower lung zone is progressing. Whether this is disseminated
 infection or edema is radiographically indeterminate, but accompanying
 moderate left pleural effusion is increasing.  On the right there has been no
 recent improvement in extensive consolidation in the mid and lower lung zones
 or in the large right pleural effusion.  Heart size is partly obscured, but
 probably not greatly enlarged.  Distended mediastinal veins indicate elevated
 central venous pressure or volume.  ET tube and right internal jugular line
 are in standard placements. There is no pneumothorax.
