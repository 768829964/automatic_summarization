                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman POD ___ s/p RUL resection.  Assess for ETT
 position
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi upright frontal chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild decrease in subcutaneous emphysema along the right lateral chest wall,
 right breast and right lateral neck.  Again seen is a 3.5 cm rounded opacity
 partially projecting over the right lower hemi thorax consistent with a small
 hematoma likely related to chest tubes.  Mild right lower lobe atelectasis is
 stable.  Left lung is clear.  No significant change in small right
 pneumothorax.  No left pneumothorax.  Trace right pleural effusion.  No left
 pleural effusion.  Heart size and mediastinal contour are otherwise
 unremarkable.
 
 Chain sutures are again seen within the left upper lobe and right lower lobe. 
 A right IJ CVL tip is in the low SVC.  An enteric feeding tube courses midline
 with tip out of field of view and side port not visualized.  2 right-sided
 chest tubes are in appropriate position, unchanged since prior examination. 
 Endotracheal tube is in appropriate position at the level of thoracic inlet.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Support lines and tubes in appropriate position.  Specifically,
 endotracheal tube at level of thoracic inlet.
 2.  Mild decrease in subcutaneous emphysema along right lateral chest wall,
 right breast and right lateral neck.
 3.  Stable small right breast/chest hematoma, likely post procedural.
 4.  Stable mild right lower lobe atelectasis with trace right pleural
 effusion.
 5.  Stable small right pneumothorax.
