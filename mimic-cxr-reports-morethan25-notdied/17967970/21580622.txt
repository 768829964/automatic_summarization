                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lung cancer s/p resection with
 ?pneumoperitoneum vs. atelectasis on Xray  // eval for interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently dated ___ from earlier in the day.  CT scan of the chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube is present.  The tip of the right PICC line extends to the
 right atrium.  Surgical clips are again noted to project over the right
 peripheral mid lung.  Chain sutures are noted in both upper lung zones.
 
 A lucency projecting over the right lung base likely corresponds to a
 pneumothorax that has been present since at least the CT scan of the chest
 dated ___.  This is the left likely reflect a pneumoperitoneum.
 
 No significant interval change in the right hilar and mid lung zone opacities.
