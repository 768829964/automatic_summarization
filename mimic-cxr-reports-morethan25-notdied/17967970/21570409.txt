                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p R VATS RUL wedge. post op bronchitis vs
 pna.  // check interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 Chest CT without contrast dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post bilateral upper lobe wedge resections.  There is
 bilateral apical pleural thickening, worse on the right, which reflects a
 combination of postoperative change and pleural fluid.  The right pleural
 effusion appears unchanged in size in comparison to the prior chest
 radiograph.  There is a focus of linear opacity in the right upper lung,
 likely representing scarring.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  Heart size is
 stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. The pulmonary
 vasculature is normal.  No pneumothorax is seen. There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Unchanged size of right pleural effusion.
 2. No evidence of pneumonia.
