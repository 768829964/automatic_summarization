 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube is
 well seated with the tip approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.  Little change
 in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, much of which represents
 interstitial lung disease.  On the recent CT, the findings were described as
 raising the suggestion of associated pulmonary hemorrhage.
