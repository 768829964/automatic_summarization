 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Residual heterogeneous pulmonary opacification has improved since earlier in
 the day.  This could be pulmonary edema but the asymmetric and somewhat
 peripheral distribution raise possibility of other diagnoses including
 pulmonary hemorrhage.  Clinical correlation advised.
 
 Cardiac silhouette is obscured, probably not substantially changed, top-normal
 size.  Pleural effusions are presumed, but not appreciable.  No pneumothorax. 
 ET tube, Swan-Ganz catheter, esophageal drainage tube are unchanged in
 standard placements.
