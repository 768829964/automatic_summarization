                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF and NSTEMI  // evaluation of pulmonary
 edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is seen.  Prominence of the perihilar
 vasculature suggests moderate pulmonary vascular congestion.  There is
 increase in left mid to lower lung opacity which may be related to worsening
 pulmonary vascular congestion in combination with left-sided pneumonia.  No
 large pleural effusion is seen although a small left pleural effusion be
 difficult to exclude.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.
