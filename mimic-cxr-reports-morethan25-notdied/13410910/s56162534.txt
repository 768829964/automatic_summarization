                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with acute MR with IABP in place. 
 Study requested for evaluation of pneumonia and line/balloon placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to prior chest radiograph from ___,
 intra-aortic balloon pump has been repositioned, now proximal to the left main
 stem bronchus.  The Swan-Ganz catheter is projecting in the right pulmonary
 artery, the device should be pulled back by approximately 3 cm.  ET tube
 terminates 4 cm above the carina.  Lung volumes remain low. Slight blunting of
 the left hemidiaphragm could be attributed to volume loss and a small
 effusion. Opacification of the right lung base could reflect atelectasis,
 however, in the appropriate clinical setting, pneumonia should also be
 considered.  
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Right lower lung opacity which could be related to atelectasis; however, in
 the proper clinical setting, pneumonia should also be considered.
 
 2. Swan-Ganz catheter projects in the right pulmonary artery, withdrawal of
 approximately 3 cm is recommended. 
 
 These findings were discussed with ___ by Dr. ___ ___
 telephone on ___ at 10:37 AM, time of discovery.
