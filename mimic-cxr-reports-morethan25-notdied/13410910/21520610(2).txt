                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Status post mitral valve replacement, evaluate for
 pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST AP:
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 3:31 a.m.
 
 The position of the various lines and tubes remains unchanged.  No evidence of
 a pneumothorax is present.  The heart remains enlarged with a mitral valve
 replacement.  Increased density behind the heart is again noted consistent
 with known atelectasis.  Effusions persist, probably unchanged.
 
 The intra-aortic balloon catheter has been removed since the prior film.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No pneumothorax.  Aortic balloon catheter removed.
