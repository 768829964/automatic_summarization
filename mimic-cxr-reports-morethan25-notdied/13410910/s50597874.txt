                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with circulatory/respiratory failure in EP lab.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 5 cm above the carina.  An intra-aortic balloon pump tip
 terminates low, approximately 3.0 cm below the left main bronchus level.  Lung
 volumes are low, but no consolidation or pneumothorax is seen.  Widening of
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette likely relates to the low lung volumes.  Mild
 aortic knob calcifications are present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Low lung volumes with resultant mild cardiomediastinal widening. 
 2. IABP terminates low, with tip 3 cm below the left main bronchus.
