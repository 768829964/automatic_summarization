 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with cardiogenic shock, intra-aortic balloon pump.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 ET tube ends 2.4 cm above the carina.  Right-sided Swan-Ganz is in right
 interlobular artery and should not be advanced further.  For safe positioning,
 it could be pulled back 2-3 cm.  Intra-aortic balloon pump ends 3.4 cm below
 the aortic knob, which is adequate.  Bibasilar consolidations, left more than
 right, is unchanged with probable small left pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  ET tube, NG tube, and intra-aortic balloon pump are in adequate position.
 2.  Right-sided Swan-Ganz could be pulled back 2-3 cm.
