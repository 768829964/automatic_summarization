  1. ETT terminates 4.6 cm above the carina.  NGT ends in the proximal stomach
  with sideholes within the expected region of the stomach.  The chest tube
  ends is in place with the tip terminating in the right apex.
  2. bilateral tiny apical  pneumothoraces better delineated on same day CT.
  3. Widened mediastinum which may reflect hematoma associated with known
  sternal fracture.
  4. Bilateral diffuse interstitial edema, contusion and hemorrhage in setting
  of trauma remain in differential. 
  5. opacification at lung bases likely atelectasis vs aspiration/infection in
  the correct clincial setting. tiny let pleural effusion cannot be excluded.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Motor vehicle accident, evaluation of endotracheal tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the endotracheal
 tube is unchanged and projects 4.5 cm above the carina.  The nasogastric tube
 ends in the proximal stomach with the sidehole.  Known chest tube in the right
 hemithorax.  Known bilateral apical pneumothoraces that are, however, better
 seen on the CT examination performed the same day.  The width of the
 mediastinum has slightly increased (known sternal fracture).  Slightly
 increasing bilateral pleural effusions.  Unchanged mild pulmonary edema.
