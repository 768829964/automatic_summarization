                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 848 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with recent trauma, status post multiple
 surgeries, now with tachycardia, question consolidation, effusion, or
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at ___.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 848 is submitted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The patient is markedly rotated to her right limiting evaluation of the
 cardiac and mediastinal contours.  The tracheostomy tube remains in
 satisfactory position. Left subclavian PICC line remains unchanged in
 position. There are likely bilateral effusions, left much greater than the
 right, which do not appear to be changed.  There continues to be patchy
 airspace disease, more on the left than the right, but again suggestive of
 atelectasis rather than an infectious process.  No evidence of pulmonary
 edema.  No pneumothorax. Bilateral rib fractures.  Cardiac stent remains in
 place.
