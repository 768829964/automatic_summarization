                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tachycardia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left PICC tip appears to have been withdrawn slightly compared to the prior
 study, now terminating in the distal left brachiocephalic vein.  Heart size
 remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is tortuous and demonstrates aortic knob
 calcifications.  Mild pulmonary edema appears slightly improved.  There are
 small bilateral pleural effusions, left greater than right, which allowing for
 differences in technique may be minimally decreased.  No pneumothorax is
 present.  There is diffuse demineralization of the osseous structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, slightly improved, with small bilateral pleural
 effusions, left greater than right which is slightly decreased in the
 interval.
