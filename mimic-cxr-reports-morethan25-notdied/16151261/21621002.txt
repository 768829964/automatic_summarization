                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with C5 paralysis  // ?interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 442
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Left subclavian PICC line is unchanged, with tip near distal SVC/RA junction.
 
 Slight interval improvement in the retrocardiac opacity, consistent with left
 lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  Minimal atelectasis the right base.
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
 
 Again seen is fracture of the mid right clavicle.  Previously seen cervical
 spine fixation hardware is not included on this film.
 
 Balloon overlying left upper quadrant consistent with GI tract tube noted.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval improvement in left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation, though
 residual retrocardiac opacity remains.  Minimal atelectasis at right lung
 base.
