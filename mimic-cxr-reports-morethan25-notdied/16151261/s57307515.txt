 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again retrocardiac
 opacification with poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with
 continued volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 The remainder of the examination is unchanged with no evidence of acute
 pneumonia or vascular congestion.  Monitoring and support devices remain in
 place and the widely separated fracture of the right clavicle is again seen.
