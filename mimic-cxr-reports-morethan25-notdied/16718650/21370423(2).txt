 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p fall with multiple injuries including pelvic fracture
 requiring IR embo for hemodynamic instability other injuries include left rib
 fractures (___), sternal fracture with substernal hematoma, SDH, left
 acetabular fracture, rami fracture, and multiple vertebral fractures  // ?
 pneumo ? tamponade   ? pneumo ? tamponade
 
 IMPRESSION:
