                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with hypoxia, increased tachypnea // Eval for
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier today, ___ at 17:59.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient has known sternal fracture with retrosternal hematoma and multiple rib
 fractures.  There may be subtle increase in left pleural fluid with fluid also
 seen at the left apex.  There is also subtle increased interstitial markings
 of the left hemi thorax which could be due to asymmetric pulmonary edema. 
 There may also be evolving contusion at the left lung base.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are grossly stable given differences in patient
 position.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
