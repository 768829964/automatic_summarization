                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p fall with pelvic fracture, left rib fractures (___),
 sternal fracture with substernal hematoma, SDH, left acetabular fracture, rami
 fracture, and multiple vertebral fractures s/p pigtail placement with
 difficulty weaning from trach to TM  // interval change   interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 05:20.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion has increased.  No appreciable left pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Bilateral pigtail pleural drainage catheters are
 unchanged in their respective positions.  Some of the worsening opacification
 in the right lower chest is probably due to concurrent atelectasis, possibly
 severe.  The upper lungs however are clear.  Heart size is normal.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is slightly turned in should be evaluated to see that it is
 appropriately positioned.  A right PIC line ends in the low SVC.
