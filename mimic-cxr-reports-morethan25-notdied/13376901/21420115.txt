  1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
  2. Focal nodular opacity in the right mid lung may represent a healing rib
  fracture.
  3. Rounded retrocardiac opacity appears atypical for a hiatal hernia,
  dedicated chest CT is recommended.
 WET READ VERSION #1 ___ ___ ___ 7:02 AM
  
  1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
  2. Irregular nodular opacity in the right mid lung may represent a healing rib
  fracture, however there is no history of interval trauma.  Dedicated chest CT
  is recommended for further evaluation.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F with hypoglycemia, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A focal nodular opacity in the right midlung is new from prior studies.  The
 appearance is most suggestive of a healing rib fracture, however there is no
 history of interval trauma.  Rounded retrocardiac opacity without definite
 correlate on the lateral view is atypical for a hiatal hernia, chest CT is
 recommended for further characterization.  Contour irregularity of the lateral
 left eighth rib likely represents remote prior rib fracture.  There is no
 focal consolidation, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  The osseous structures and upper
 abdomen are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
 2. Focal nodular opacity in the right mid lung may represent a healing rib
 fracture and less likely a lung nodule.
 3. Rounded retrocardiac opacity likely corresponds to previously demonstrated
 paraspinal mass on MR of ___ and earlier CT abdomen studies.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Dedicated chest CT is recommended.
