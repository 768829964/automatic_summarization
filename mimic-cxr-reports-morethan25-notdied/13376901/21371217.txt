                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, pulled her endotracheal tube and moved the
 position.  Evaluation for position change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 5:56.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the endotracheal tube has
 been advanced.  The tip of the tube now projects 3.6 cm above the carina.  The
 other monitoring and support devices are constant.
 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette as well as the diffuse bilateral
 predominantly alveolar opacities in the lung parenchyma in the absence of
 major pleural effusions is constant.  No evidence of complications, notably no
 pneumothorax.
