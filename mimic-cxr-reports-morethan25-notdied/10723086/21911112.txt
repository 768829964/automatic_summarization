                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F w/ acute SOB  // evaluate for aspiration and position of NG
 tube
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Due to technique and patient body habitus evaluation of the lungs is very
 limited. The tip of the NG tube cannot be clearly seen, can be followed to the
 lower esophagus. Moderate cardiomegaly is stable. Tracheostomy tube is in
 standard position.  Right PICC tip is in the upper SVC.  There is no
 pneumothorax. Left HD catheter is in standard position. Retrocardiac opacities
 are unchanged consistent with large area of atelectasis. Extensive bilateral
 opacities partially due to pulmonary edema have minimally improved. The
 opacities are larger on the right with some nodular component. There are
 presumed small right greater than left pleural effusion
