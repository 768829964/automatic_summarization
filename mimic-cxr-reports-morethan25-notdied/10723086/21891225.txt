                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Morbid obesity with fevers and retrocardiac density.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the left hemidiaphragm is more
 sharply seen.  It is extremely difficult to determine whether the retrocardiac
 opacification truly represents a finding, or merely a manifestation of
 extensive scattered radiation related to the size of the patient.
