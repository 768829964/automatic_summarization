                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ through ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The study is severely limited by patient body habitus.  Within this
 limitation, there are worsening rounded opacities in the right mid and lower
 lung.  On the lateral radiograph, there is a large opacity posteriorly, also
 likely in the right lung, although not definitely confirmed on the frontal
 projection.  Large left pleural effusion has likely increased in size. 
 Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  There may be a background of mild pulmonary
 edema. There is no evidence of large pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Worsening rounded opacities in the right lung worrisome for multifocal
 pneumonia possibly from septic emboli. Wegener's should also be considered. 
 2. Moderate cardiomegaly and likely a background of mild pulmonary edema.
