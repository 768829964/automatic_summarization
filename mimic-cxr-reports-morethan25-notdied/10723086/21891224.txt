                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fevers.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back through ___, including the most recent study from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of a left PICC.  A single frontal
 radiograph of the chest was acquired.  Hazy opacification of the mid-to-lower
 lungs is partially attributable to overlying soft tissues.  Retrocardiac dense
 opacification is not significantly changed compared to the prior study and is
 likely attributable to atelectasis, although infection or effusion at the left
 lung base cannot be excluded.  There is no right pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  The heart size is somewhat difficult to assess,
 although appears mildly enlarged, unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged left retrocardiac opacification, likely secondary to
 atelectasis, although concomitant infection or effusion at the left lung base
 is certainly possible.
