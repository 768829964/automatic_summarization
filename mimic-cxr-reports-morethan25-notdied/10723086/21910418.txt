 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dating back to ___. 
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion appear overall
 stable compared to the prior exam.  There is a focal consolidation in the
 right lower lobe,which appears new compared to the prior exam.  Small left
 pleural effusion appears stable. The aorta is mildly tortuous, otherwise the
 hilar mediastinal contours are normal.  There is no evidence of a
 pneumothorax.
