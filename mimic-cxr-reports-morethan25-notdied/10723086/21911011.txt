                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE RADIOGRAPHS ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 Radiographs were obtained to evaluate a nasogastric tube.  Although a
 nasogastric tube is clearly visualized in the proximal and mid esophageal
 region, the catheter is not confidently visualized beyond this region. 
 However, the patient body habitus and technique result in poor visibility of
 the lower thoracic and upper abdominal regions.  Repeat radiograph with
 improved technique may be helpful in this regard.
