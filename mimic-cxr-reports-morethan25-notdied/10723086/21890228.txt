                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, cough, and hyperkalemia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, two semi-upright AP portable views.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a right-sided PICC line terminating in the superior vena
 cava or lower, but its tip is not well delineated.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 noted with bilateral perihilar fullness and prominent indistinct vascularity
 suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion, although less prominent.  The
 costophrenic sulci are not well visualized laterally due to overlying soft
 tissue structures but there is no definite evidence for pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings suggesting pulmonary vascular congestion but improved.
