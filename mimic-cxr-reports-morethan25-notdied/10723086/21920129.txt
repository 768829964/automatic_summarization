                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with metastatic choriocarcinoma, unable to have
 CT chest for staging  // please eval previously noted nodules for progression
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Allowing for patient rotation, cardiomediastinal contours are stable. Poorly
 defined nodular opacities in the right lung are similar to the prior exam in
 could be more fully evaluated by standard PA and lateral radiograph when the
 patient's condition permits. Previously reported pulmonary vascular congestion
 has improved.
