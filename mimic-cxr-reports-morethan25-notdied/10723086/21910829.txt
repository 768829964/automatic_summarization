                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with morbid obesity, recurrent cellulitis,
 fever and cough, shortness of breath.  // pneumonia? infiltrates?
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___. impression
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Extensive opacification, diffuse in the right lung, is probable pneumonia.
 Given the size of this patient CT scanning is vasculature visible in the left
 lung is still engorged, but I doubt there is left-sided pulmonary edema,
 indicated to precisely characterize and localize the abnormality. The severe
 enlargement of cardiac silhouette may have progressed the volume of presumed
 right pleural effusion is impossible to assess on a single frontal view. Left
 pleural effusion is small if any. Left basal atelectasis is substantial, and
 unchanged recently. .
