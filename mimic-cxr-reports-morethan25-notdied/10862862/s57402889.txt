                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with resp failure  // eval for interval change   
 eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitor and support devices
 are essentially unchanged.  Obliquity of the patient makes it difficult to
 evaluate the cardiac silhouette.  There is again opacification at the left
 base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with pleural effusion and
 volume loss in the left lower lobe.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this
 could represent pneumonia.
 There is suggestion of some increased opacification in the right upper zone,
 but this could merely represent previous pulmonary markings superimposed on
 the right clavicle because of the obliquity of the patient.
 Old right clavicular fracture is seen.
