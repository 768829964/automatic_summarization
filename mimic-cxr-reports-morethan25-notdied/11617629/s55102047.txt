                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute decomp heart failure // central line
 positioning, e/o pulm edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 1 day prior, mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion has increased.  No pulmonary edema.  Moderate to severe
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Increased, now moderate right pleural effusion.
 Right pleural pigtail catheter appears unchanged in position.  There may be
 bibasilar atelectasis, but no evidence to suggest pneumonia.  The right IJ
 sheath terminates at the origin of the SVC, a right PICC terminates in the
 lower SVC, and a single pacemaker lead is unchanged in position and probably
 terminates in the right ventricle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increased mild pulmonary vascular congestion, but no pulmonary edema.  A
 right-sided PICC terminates in the lower SVC and a right IJ sheath terminates
 in near the origin of the SVC.
