                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with cardioegenic shock s/p intubation  //
 intubation
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs flow most recently ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is interval placement of an endotracheal tube terminating approximately
 4.9 cm above the carina.  A Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the right main
 pulmonary artery, unchanged.  The left pigtail pleural drain projecting over
 the left lateral base is also stable in position.  Allowing for slightly
 increased lung volumes and differences in technique heart size has slightly
 decreased and the central vasculature is less prominent.  Mild to moderate
 pulmonary edema has slightly improved.  Small left pleural effusion has
 decreased.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Interval placement of an endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
 
 2.  Improved mild-to-moderate diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema and
 decreased small left pleural effusion.
