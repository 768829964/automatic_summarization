  The mediastinum and mid lungs are somewhat obscured by overlying battery pack
  devices and multiple leads.  Within the limitations, mld pulmonary edema seems
  similar to the prior exam from earlier today, though there is an improvement
  in the aeration at the right base.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
  identified.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged.
