                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with b/l chest tube, R with significant decreased
 drainage  // eval effusions
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to ___ chest radiograph, Swan-Ganz catheter has been
 removed with residual right internal jugular vascular sheath in place.  Severe
 diffuse pulmonary edema is again demonstrated.  A worsening area of
 consolidation is present in the periphery of the right upper lobe and within
 the adjacent right lower lobe, and may reflect worsening asymmetrical edema or
 a secondary process such as aspiration or developing infectious pneumonia. 
 Followup radiographs after diuresis may be helpful in this regard. Bilateral
 pleural catheters remain in place, with increasing small to moderate right
 pleural effusion.
