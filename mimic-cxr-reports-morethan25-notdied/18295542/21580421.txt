                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 3:40 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with bronchiectasis, after bronchoscopy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Only the most inferior of a group of ropey opacities at the left hilus has
 improved.  These are probably persistent mucoid impactions in the setting of
 severe bronchiectasis.  I see no findings to suggest pneumonia.  Heart size is
 normal.  There is no pleural effusion.  Tracheostomy tube in place, is less
 than half the transverse diameter of the trachea and would not be effective
 for positive pressure ventilator support.  Gastrostomy tube in place, cannot
 be localized on conventional radiographs.  No pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.
