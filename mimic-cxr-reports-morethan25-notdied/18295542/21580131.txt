                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day early in the
 morning.
 
 There is no significant interval change.  There is no evident large
 pneumothorax, but as before, differentiation of pneumothorax from known large
 apical bullae is difficult.  There are no new lung abnormalities.  Small left
 pleural effusion is unchanged.  The tracheostomy tube is in standard position.
 Left PICC tip is in the lower SVC.
