                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with increased ventilator
 pressure requirement.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to prior study obtained the same day
 earlier.
 
 The tracheostomy is in place, unchanged.  Heart size and mediastinum are
 unchanged.  There is mild interval progression of perihilar vascular opacities
 and indistinctness of the pulmonary vessels that might be consistent with
 interval progression of pulmonary edema.  Bibasal consolidations are
 unchanged.  No interval increase in pleural effusion or development of
 pneumothorax is seen.
