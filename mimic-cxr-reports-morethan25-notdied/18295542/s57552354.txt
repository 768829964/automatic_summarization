                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP SUPINE CHEST FILM ___ AT 08:20.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with cavitary pneumonia and pneumothorax
 with new respiratory distress.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 03:42.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 08:20 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tracheostomy tube, left subclavian PICC line, feeding tube and left chest
 tube remain unchanged in position.
 
 2.  Persistent left lower lobe airspace consolidation is essentially stable
 but may reflect atelectasis versus pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is
 advised.  Left lateral chest wall subcutaneous emphysema is essentially
 unchanged.  No definite pneumothorax is seen although the sensitivity to
 detect pneumothorax is diminished given supine technique.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
