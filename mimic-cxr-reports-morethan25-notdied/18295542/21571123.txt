                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with tracheostomy in place, pneumonia, and recent
 pneumothorax.
 
 STUDY:  Portable semi-upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:  A tracheostomy is in place.  Feeding tube tip sits in
 the distal stomach.  A left-sided chest tube is in place.  The
 cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  The lungs continue to demonstrate
 retrocardiac opacity as well as a developing left upper lobe consolidation,
 representing either aspriation or pneumonia in the appropriate clinical
 setting.  There is no large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  Extensive
 subcutaneous emphysema is demonstrated throughout the visualized soft tissues.
