                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A PICC line terminates in the right axillary line on the right.  A
 gastrostomy tube projects over the left upper quadrant.  A tracheostomy is in
 place.  The cardiac, mediastinal, and hilar contours appear unchanged
 including borderline cardiomegaly.  There is new left basilar opacification,
 although fairly plate-like and streaky which may indicate atelectasis.  There
 is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Patchy left basilar opacity.  Pneumonia is a differential consideration,
 although the morphology is fairly typical for atelectasis.
 
 2.  PICC line terminating in the right axilla, placed since the prior study.
