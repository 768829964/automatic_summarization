                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single frontal supine view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  A tracheostomy tube is in satisfactory position with the tip in the
 mid trachea.  The lungs are hyperinflated with distortion of the pulmonary
 vasculature, most consistent with chronic changes of COPD.  There is an
 opacity with air bronchograms in the retrocardiac region.  Additionally, there
 is a focal opacity in the right lower lobe.  A small left pleural effusion is
 present.  There is no right pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, or
 pneumothorax.  Pleural calcifications are noted.  Allowing for technique, the
 cardiac size is at the upper limits of normal.  The mediastinal contours are
 normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Bibasilar opacities, slightly more prominent on the right than the left,
 are concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
 2.  Probable small left pleural effusion.
 2.  Hyperinflation, likely due to COPD.
