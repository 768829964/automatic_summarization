                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 12:13
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pneumothorax, chest tube to waterseal,
 assess for interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior studies from ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 12:13 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Right subclavian PICC line, tracheostomy tube, and chest tube remain in
 position.  The left apicolateral pneumothorax does not appear to be
 significantly changed.  Slightly improved aeration in the lungs with residual
 blunting of the left costophrenic angle and patchy lower lobe opacity likely
 representing combination of compressive atelectasis and pleural effusion. 
 There has been interval appearance of mild vascular congestion as well as
 progression of patchy opacity at the right medial lung base which also likely
 reflects patchy atelectasis.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.
