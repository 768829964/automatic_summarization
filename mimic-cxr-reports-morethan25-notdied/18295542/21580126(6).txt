                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Patient with history of COPD with recurrent pneumothoraces,
 status post pleurodesis.  Assess for pneumothorax recurrence.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position.  Right PIC catheter tip projects
 over mid SVC.  Moderate left pneumothorax is noted.  There is no right
 pneumothorax.  Left costophrenic angle is blunted, suggestive of
 small-to-moderate pleural effusion or changes related to pleurodesis.  Left
 lung base opacity likely represents atelectasis.  Hilar and mediastinal
 silhouettes are unchanged.  Heart size is top normal.  PEG tube is in place. 
 Partially imaged upper abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Moderate left pneumothorax.
