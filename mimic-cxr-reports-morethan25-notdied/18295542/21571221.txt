                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tracheostomy and respiratory distress.  Evaluate for acute
 process.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tip of a tracheostomy tube ends approximately 5.7 cm from the
 carina.  A left PICC ends in the low SVC.  A feeding tube is seen in the
 stomach with the tip out of the field of view.  Stable scarring and fibrosis
 is seen in the left upper lobe.  Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.  At the
 left base, hazy opacification likely represents the patient's known left
 basilar bronchiectasis and scarring.  There is no new consolidation.  There is
 no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute change from prior radiograph.
 2.  Stable left upper lobe scarring, left basilar bronchiectasis, and
 bibasilar atelectasis.
