                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  History of cavitary pneumonia, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Status post tracheostomy.  Borderline size of the cardiac silhouette
 without pulmonary edema.  Unchanged left upper lobe predominant scars. 
 Atelectasis at the right lung bases.  No larger pleural effusions.  No newly
 occurred parenchymal changes.
