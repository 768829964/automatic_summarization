                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:50 PM, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Chest tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 5:21 a.m.:
 
 Left pleural tube enters chest laterally, mid level, and it curls against the
 mediastinum, terminating roughly at the level of the diaphragm, but I can not
 tell whether it is anterior or posterior to the heart.  Small volume of
 pleural air is still present along the upper lateral lung, and a small amount
 at the base of the left lung is new.  There is no appreciable pleural
 effusion, but there is new considerable subcutaneous emphysema along the left
 chest wall, entering the neck and crossing the midline.  Heart size is top
 normal.  Right lung is clear.
