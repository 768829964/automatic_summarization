                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with COPD and recurrent pneumonia complicated
 by pneumothorax status post pleurodesis and chest tube removal, here to
 reassess for interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph performed earlier the same day at 03:00 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position.  A right-sided PICC
 line is unchanged in position with the tip overlying the upper SVC.  The
 moderate to large left pneumothorax has increased in size from the preceding
 chest radiographs, now with a basal component (previously only apical).  A
 left pleural effusion is decreased in size from the preceding study.  Known
 emphysema is unchanged.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal in size.  The
 hilar and mediastinal contours are stable.  A PEG tube is noted in the left
 upper abdomen.  Large retrocardiac atelectasis is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased moderate to large left pneumothorax with decreased
 small left pleural effusion.
 
 Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ by phone at 4:30
