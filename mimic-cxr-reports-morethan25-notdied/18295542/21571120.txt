                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with pneumothorax and chest tube.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A tracheostomy is in place.  The endogastric tube courses
 inferiorly out of the field of view.  There is noted to be a left-sided chest
 tube in place.  Widespread subcutaneous emphysema is seen throughout
 practically all the visualized soft tissues.  The heart size is large, but
 stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  A right-sided
 central venous catheter tip is seen at the lower SVC.  The overlying soft
 tissue emphysema limits assessment of the lung consolidations.  There is no
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
