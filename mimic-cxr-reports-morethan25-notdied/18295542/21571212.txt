                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of the patient with history of COPD, bronchiectasis,
 congestive heart failure, presenting with sepsis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs including the most recent from
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left subclavian PICC line is visualized with the tip at upper SVC. 
 Tracheostomy tube is visualized in position.  An enteric tube is visualized
 with tip traversing through the stomach but out of the field of view.  Small
 left pleural effusion as well as a tiny right pleural effusion, stable in
 comparison to prior study.  There is, however, improved aeration of bilateral
 lower lobes with less atelectasis. Destructive lung parenchyma and
 bronchiectatic changes in the left upper lobe appear stable. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild improvement in bilateral lower lung aeration.  Small
 bilateral pleural effusions persist, left greater than right.
