 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube is present.  There is a left central line with tip in the
 upper SVC.  There is no pneumothorax .There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is pulmonary vascular
 redistribution and hazy patchy alveolar infiltrate most marked in the left
 lung and right lower lobe.

 infectious infiltrate is also present.
