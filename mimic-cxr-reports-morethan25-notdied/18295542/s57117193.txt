                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with sob and trach.  // ro pna
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___, ___, ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates bilateral pleural
 effusions with linear opacity at the left lung base, which is new since the
 most recent examination, and likely represents atelectasis.  Again noted are
 bibasilar, patchy opacities, which are not significantly changed since at
 least ___, except for some more nodular regions in the right
 peripheral lung.  A possible retrocardiac opacity is present, which in the
 appropriate clinical context, may be consistent with pneumonia.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  Tracheostomy tube is appropriately positioned.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent, bilateral pleural effusion and bilateral opacities.  Retrocardiac
 opacity, in the appropriate clinical context, may represent pneumonia. 
 Consider re-imaging after treatment to document resolution.
