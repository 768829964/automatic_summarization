                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Low-grade fever and increased sputum in patient with tracheostomy.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 somewhat better inspiration.  The left subclavian catheter appears to have
 been removed, while the tracheostomy and Dobbhoff tube remain in place.  Mild
 atelectatic changes are again seen at the left base, though the hemidiaphragm
 is more sharply visualized.  Indistinctness of pulmonary vessels raises the
 possibility of some elevated pulmonary venous pressure.
