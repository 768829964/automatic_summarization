                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest tube removal, please evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed same day 11
 hours earlier and ___ chest CT.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval removal of the
 left-sided chest tube.  There is deficiency of lung markings in the left upper
 lung likely related to the extensive large emphysematous bulla demonstrated on
 ___ chest CT.  No new large pneumothorax evident.  A right-sided
 PICC line is stable in position with tip terminating in the mid SVC.  The 
 tracheostomy cannula is stable.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged.  There is stable bibasilar consolidations likely related to known
 atelectasis, scarring and bronchiectasis as well as a combination of
 atelectasis and small left effusion on the left.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval uncomlicated removal of chest tube.  Emphysematous bulla
 somewhat limiting evaluation of pneumothorax, though no new large pneumothorax
 evident.
