                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with h/o thymoma s/p resection x2, myasthenia
 ___ p/w hypercarbic respiratory failure now s/p bronch and new respiratory
 distress  // ? ptx     ? ptx
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 07:55
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 13 22 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube, right internal jugular central line, right subclavian PICC
 line, and feeding tube are unchanged in position.  The more nodular patchy
 opacities in the right costophrenic angle and at the left lung base have
 somewhat improved. However, there is persistent consolidation in the
 retrocardiac region which may represent an area of pneumonia or lower lobe
 atelectasis in the setting of a layering pleural effusion. Clinical
 correlation is advised. The pulmonary vasculature is somewhat ill-defined and
 this likely reflects superimposed mild edema. No pneumothorax. The patient is
 status post median sternotomy with expected postoperative changes in the left
 hemithorax.
