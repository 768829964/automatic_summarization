                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post CABG with prolonged intubation. 
 Question interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube has tip extending to 3.3 cm above the carina.  A
 right-sided central venous catheter sheath and enteric tube traversing
 inferiorly out of view appear unchanged.  There has been interval removal of a
 Swan-Ganz catheter.  There is overall marked increase in cardiac size as
 compared to four days prior, even allowing for underlying cardiomegaly would
 suspect possible development of a pericardial effusion.  The right lung is
 relatively well aerated.  
 
 The left upper lung now demonstrates increased ill-defined opacity, suggestive
 of a combination of evolving pulmonary consolidation superimposed on layering
 pleural effusion.  The retrocardiac opacity persists, which could represent
 atelectasis versus consolidation.  Median sternotomy wires are intact. 
 Multiple clips are seen projecting over the heart, suggestive of prior CABG.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Significant interval enlargement of cardiac silhouette raises the question
 of pericardial effusion despite underlying cardiomegaly.  
 2. More confluent left upper lobe consolidation with concurrent pleural
 effusion, concerning for evolving infection. 
 
 Findings reported to Dr. ___ via phone at approximately 5 pm on
 ___.
