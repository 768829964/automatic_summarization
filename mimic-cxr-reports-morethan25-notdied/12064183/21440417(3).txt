                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post CABG and chest tube
 removal.  Study requested for evaluation of pneumothorax.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval removal of the left pleural and mediastinal
 drains. Endotracheal tube is no less than 7 cm from the carina.  Swan-Ganz
 catheter tip is seen within the proximal right pulmonary artery. An enteric
 tube is seen within the stomach. Sternotomy wires are intact.
 
 There is a hazy opacity within the right lower lobe, likely a pleural effusion
 which is either stable or improved.  There is obscuration of the left lower
 lobe, which could represent increased effusion and/or atelectasis.  There is
 increased pulmonary and mediastinal vasculature congestion. There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Mild cardiac decompensation.
 
 2.  Endotracheal tube no less than 7 cm from the carina, for which advancing
 2-3 cm is recommended for a more secure seating.
