                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with myelodysplastic
 syndrome with fevers and respiratory failure.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 5.3 cm above the carina.  NG tube passes
 below the diaphragm most likely terminating in the stomach.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is grossly unchanged since the prior study allowing the lower lung
 volumes.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are re-demonstrated.  There is
 right lower lobe opacity most likely reflecting pleural effusion, but
 infectious process cannot be excluded.
