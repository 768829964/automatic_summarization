                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:00 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome after an allograft
 bone marrow transplant with respiratory failure.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Worsening heterogeneous consolidation in the left lung, and stable or improved
 consolidation in the right lung is difficult to explain by a single diagnosis.
 It is possible that pneumonia in the right lung is responding to treatment,
 but not in the left.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal widening suggests
 volume overload.  Pleural effusions are not appreciable.  ET tube is in
 standard placement, left internal jugular line ends in the upper to mid SVC,
 and an upper enteric drainage tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
