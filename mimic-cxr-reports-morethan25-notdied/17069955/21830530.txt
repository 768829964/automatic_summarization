 cell transplant with increasing leukocytosis and risk for aspiration. 
 Evaluate for aspiration or other infectious process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is poor inspiratory effort causing vascular crowding and
 exaggeration of heart size.  There is persistent mild interstitial pulmonary
 edema, unchanged from prior study.  Bibasilar atelectasis is unchanged.  There
 is no focal consolidation worrisome for infection.  There is no large effusion
 or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent mild pulmonary edema without focal consolidation
 worrisome for infection.
