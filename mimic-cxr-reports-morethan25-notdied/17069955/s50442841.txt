 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with unsuccessful internal
 jugular central venous placement attempt.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior study obtained the same day earlier.
 
 The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip is not clearly
 seen, passes below the diaphragm most likely.  No change in left more than
 right basal areas of atelectasis is demonstrated, but there is interval
 development of mild interstitial pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.
