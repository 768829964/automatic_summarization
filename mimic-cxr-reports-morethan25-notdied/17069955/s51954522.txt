                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent appearing influenza now with altered mental status and
 worsening respiratory status.  Evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ image ___ ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A right-sided PICC terminates in the lower SVC.  A enteric tube
 courses along the esophagus and terminates out of the field of view. 
 
 There is improved aeration of the lungs.  The cardiac silhouette remains
 enlarged.  The appearance of the mediastinum is unchanged and can be accounted
 for by mediastinal lipomatosis.  There is no focal consolidation or
 pneumothorax.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Old right rib fractures
 are demonstrated.  
 
 IMPRESSION: No acute cardiopulmonary process.
