                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with s/p arrest, intubated*** WARNING *** Multiple
 patients with same last name!  // eval for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  None
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 5 cm above the carina.  Right greater than the
 left bibasilar opacities likely relate to aspiration as seen on preceding CT,
 small underlying right pleural effusion not excluded.  No large pneumothorax
 is seen.  Cardiac silhouette is mildly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  Bilateral rib fractures are better assessed on CT. Chronic
 appearing deformity of the proximal right humerus is seen.
