                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with a left-sided diaphragmatic rupture status
 post  repair.
 
 COMPARISONS: Chest Radiograph from ___ at 3:48am.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval repair of the left-sided diaphragmatic
 rupture.  There has been interval re-expansion of the left lung. The left lung
 is clear. There has appears to be interval increase in opacification of the
 right lung, likely secondary to pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are no definite pleural
 effusions. Heart size is normal.  ET tube terminates 2.7 cm above the carina. 
 The bilateral chest tubes are in place. There seems to be an NG tube coiled in
 the upper esophagus. There are opacifications in the left subdiaphragmatic
 area, likely secondary to drains, however a foreign body cannot be ruled out.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1. Interval repair of the diaphragmatic rupture with re-expansion of the left
 lung. Left lung is clear.
 
 2. Increased opacification of the right lung, likely secondary to pulmonary
 vascular congestion and pulmonary edema.
 
 3. Enteric tube appears to be coiled in the upper esophagus.
 
 4. Left subdiaphragmatic opacifications, likely secondary to drains, however,
 foreign body cannot be ruled out.
