                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Closure of open abdomen.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso ___ and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Within the chest, a tracheostomy tube terminates in standard position.  A post
 pyloric feeding tube terminates within the proximal duodenum.  Heart size is
 normal.  Pulmonary vascularity is not engorged.  Linear opacities in the
 medial aspect of the right lung likely reflect atelectasis.  Retrocardiac
 opacity also likely reflects atelectasis.  No large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is identified. Nondisplaced right 8th rib fracture is again
 noted.  No radiopaque foreign bodies are otherwise noted.  
 
 Within the abdomen and pelvis, an inferior vena cava filter is identified in
 unchanged position.  Oral contrast material is seen within the descending
 colon and rectum.  No radiopaque foreign bodies are otherwise demonstrated. 
 Widened right sacroiliac joint is noted as well as diastasis of the pubic
 symphysis.  Again seen are fractures of the left L1 and L2 transverse
 processes.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 No retained radiopaque foreign body identified.  Findings discussed with Dr.
 ___ at 22:40, ___.
