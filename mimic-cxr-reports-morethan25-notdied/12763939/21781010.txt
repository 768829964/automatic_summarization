                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post motor vehicle accident.  History of
 diaphragmatic rupture who presents for evaluation after left chest tube was
 placed on waterseal.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___,
 ___ and CT torso from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tracheostomy appears in standard position.  There is a
 left-sided chest tube which abuts the mediastinum.  Again noted is the feeding
 tube looped in the hypopharynx, yet extending down below the diaphragm with
 the tip out of view of the film.  The right subclavian catheter ends in the
 low SVC.  Again seen is bilateral perihilar opacification which could be
 secondary to atelectasis or pneumonia, unchanged compared to the prior exam.
 No new focal consolidations are seen.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusions.  The heart size is normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Unchanged perihilar opacification bilaterally, likely secondary to atelectasis
 or pneumonia. No pneumothorax.
