                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bronchoscopy with desaturation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is again
 extensive opacification in the retrocardiac region consistent with volume loss
 in the lower lobe.  Hazy opacification in the lower left lung is consistent
 with pleural effusion.  No convincing evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 The dense streak of atelectasis in the right mid zone seen previously is not
 appreciated at this time.  Monitoring and support devices are essentially
 unchanged.
