                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Bilateral chest tubes in a patient with history of
 trauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 The AP radiograph demonstrated the patient continues to be intubated with the
 ET tube being just above the carina, 1.6 cm and should be pulled back for
 approximately 2 cm.  Bilateral chest tubes are in place, there is no
 substantial change since the prior study.  There is minimal interval
 improvement in the right upper and mid lung consolidation.  No definitive
 right pneumothorax is seen.  Minimal left apical pneumothorax is suspected.
