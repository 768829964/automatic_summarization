 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:08 PM
  
  1. Since the prior chest radiograph performed earlier on the same date, there
  has been interval advancement of the endotracheal tube which now terminates
  6.4 cm above the carina.  Other support lines and devices are in stable
  position.
  2. No significant interval change in bilateral heterogeneous airspace
  opacities.
  3. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ARDS; ETT advanced  // please eval ETT    
 please eval ETT
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to prior chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 17:55.
 
 Extensive heterogeneous pulmonary abnormality, probably combination of edema
 and widespread pneumonia has not changed appreciably.  On most preceding
 examinations there is the distinct suggestion of pulmonary nodules, perhaps
 even cavitated nodules.  CT scanning would be helpful in confirmation.
 
 Moderate pleural effusions however have increased.  Moderate enlargement of
 the cardiac silhouette is stable.  Indwelling Cardiopulmonary support devices
 are in standard placements unchanged.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Consider CT scanning for better characterization of severe
 pulmonary abnormality, including possible pulmonary nodules.
