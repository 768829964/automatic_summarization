  1. Endotracheal tube terminates 5.4 cm above the carina.
  2. Multifocal consolidations, presumably representing pneumonia. Nodular
  opacities in the left midlung with central lucency, may be due to cavitation
  or incomplete consolidation.
  3. Presumed small bilateral pleural effusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with pna, flu  // eval ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5.4 cm above the carina.  Right
 IJ catheter is appropriately positioned.  An enteric tube courses to at least
 the body of the stomach, although the distal tip is not captured on the
 current study.
 
 Multifocal consolidation  and smaller nodular opacities, some apparently
 cavitated, are due to widespread infection, including pneumonia and possible
 septic emboli.  The lung apices are spared.  Moderate cardiac enlargement,
 pulmonary vascular congestion and mild edema mild edema and likely small
 bilateral pleural effusions reflect cardiac decompensation.  Detection of
 pericardial effusion would require echocardiography.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Endotracheal tube terminates 5.4 cm above the carina.
 2. Multifocal consolidations, presumably pneumonia.  Peripheral lung nodules,
 with possible cavitation could be septic emboli or other foci of pneumonia.
 3. Mild pulmonary edema, moderate cardiomegaly, and probable small pleural
 effusions.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Chest CT to determine the extent and character of
 pulmonary infection, and possible pericardial effusion.
