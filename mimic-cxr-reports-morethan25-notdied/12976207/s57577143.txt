                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pna  // eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ chest radiograph, a left internal jugular
 catheter has been slightly withdrawn, now terminating in the left
 brachiocephalic vein just proximal to the superior vena cava.  Right lower
 lobe opacity has nearly resolved in the interval, and a left retrocardiac
 opacification has worsened with persistent adjacent small left pleural
 effusion.  No other relevant change.
