                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with IPH  // ETT position, interval changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, endotracheal tube
 terminates 2.4 cm above the carina.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable. 
 Bibasilar atelectasis has improved in the interval, but a new area of
 opacification has developed in the right juxta hilar region, likely in the
 superior segment of the right lower lobe.  This could reflect focal
 atelectasis, aspiration, or developing pneumonia.
