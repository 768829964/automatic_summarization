                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position.  Note is
 made of right PICC terminating in right axilla. Bibasilar opacities are worse
 on the left and slightly improved on the right.  Additional poorly defined
 opacities in the right mid lung region probably correspond to small airways
 disease on interval CT torso of ___.  These findings probably
 represent multifocal aspiration and/or evolving aspiration pneumonia.
 Hyperlucency in left upper quadrant of abdomen could potentially be
 projectional, but basilar left pneumothorax is an additional important
 consideration.  Although no pneumothorax was evident on the CT torso of
 ___, consideration of additional right lateral decubitus view of
 the left lung is suggested to exclude the possibility of left basilar
 pneumothorax as discussed with Dr ___ by phone at 9:30 am on ___ at
 the time of discovery.
