                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single frontal view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Status post trach.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  There has been
 interval placement of a midline tracheostomy tube.  A right-sided peripheral
 catheter terminating in the region of right axillary vein is again seen. 
 There are relatively low lung volumes which accentuate the bronchovascular
 markings.  There is slight increase in left base retrocardiac opacities likely
 due to atelectasis.  Cardiac silhouette remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta is
 tortuous.  There may be minimal central pulmonary vascular engorgement without
 overt pulmonary edema.
