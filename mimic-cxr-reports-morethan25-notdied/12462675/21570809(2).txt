                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  SAH and seizure.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  Right IJ catheter tip is
 in the mid-to-lower SVC.  NG tube tip is out of view below the diaphragm. 
 Bibasilar opacities have increased, consistent with increasing effusions and
 adjacent atelectasis, larger on the right side.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary
 edema has increased.  No evident pneumothorax.
