                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post aneurysm clipping.  Evaluation for ARDS.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pleural effusion on the
 right has mildly increased.  There is unchanged evidence of bilateral areas of
 atelectasis and blunting of the left costophrenic sinus, likely caused by a
 small pleural effusion.  Despite the presence of the effusions and the
 subsequent areas of atelectasis, the lungs do not display a typical image for
 ARDS.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  The monitoring and
 support devices are constant.
