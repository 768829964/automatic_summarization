                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient, SAH.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Moderate vascular congestion is stable.  Bibasilar opacities have increased on
 the left.  This could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot
 be excluded.  Probably small effusions are unchanged allowing the difference
 in positioning of the patient.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged position.
