                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval placement of endotracheal tube, with tip terminating
 approximately 1.8 cm above the carina.  This could be withdrawn several
 centimeters for standard positioning.  Right internal jugular central venous
 catheter terminates in the mid superior vena cava, and a nasogastric tube
 terminates in the stomach.  Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal
 limits for technique.  Diffuse bilateral calcified pleural plaques are
 present, in keeping with prior asbestos exposure.  There are likely
 superimposed opacities at both lung bases, which may reflect atelectasis or
 aspiration given their rapid development.  Small left pleural effusion is also
 noted, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
