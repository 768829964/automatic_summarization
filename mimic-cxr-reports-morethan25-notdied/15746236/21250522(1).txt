 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:08 PM
  A series of 3 bedside AP radiographs were taken.  The ones labeled 18:18 and
  18:23 show the Dobhoff looped in the esophagus and traveling cephalad.  The
  third study labeled 18:32 depicts a properly positioned NGT with the sideport
  at the GE junction.  This could be advanced 2-3 cm.  The patient has been
  extubated.  The left subclavian line is unchanged.  Mild pulmonary edema may
  have worsened from this morning, possibly as a result of extubation.
