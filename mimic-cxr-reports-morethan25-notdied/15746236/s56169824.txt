                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY
 
 INDICATION:  Patient with ruptured PCOM coiling.  Followup pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Residual mild pulmonary edema has possibly slightly increased since previous
 exam.  This could be only due to the different positioning of the patient. 
 The increase in left lower lung opacity could be due to accumulation of
 pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.  ET tube ends at 3.8 cm above
 carina.  Left subclavian line is in mid SVC.  NG tube is in the stomach.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tube and lines are in adequate position.
 2.  Residual pulmonary edema is mild and possibly slightly increased since
 previous exam.  This could only be due to the positioning of the patient.
