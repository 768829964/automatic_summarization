                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post aneurysmal coiling for subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Multiple chest radiographs
 dating to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, there is no significant change.  An
 endotracheal tube is present approximately 3.6 cm from the carina.  An
 orogastric tube is in place with the tip in the stomach.  A side port is near
 the gastroesophageal junction.  Again, there are bilateral interstitial
 abnormalities, likely due to mild pulmonary edema.  It is not significantly
 changed from the prior exam.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely
 present.  There is no new consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 No significant change from the prior exam.  Mild pulmonary edema and probable
 small pleural effusions persist.
