                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Subarachnoid hemorrhage and resolving congestive
 heart failure, re-assessment.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study from
 ___.  
 
 A tracheostomy is in place.  The left PICC line tip at the level of the mid
 low SVC.  Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.  There is no substantial
 change in bilateral pleural effusions and bibasal consolidations.  Lucency
 seen on the prior study is not seen on the current study, most likely
 reflecting re-distribution of pleural fluid.  No pneumothorax.
