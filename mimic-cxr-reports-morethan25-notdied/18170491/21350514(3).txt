                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left basal ganglia IPH/IVH sinus status post tracheostomy. 
 Please evaluate for any pneumomediastinum.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___ hours

 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of
 tracheostomy tube.  No evidence of pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax, however
 a pneumoperitoneum is evident.  Unchanged contours of the cardiomediastinal
 and hilar borders.  Right-sided subclavian catheter with tip in the distal
 SVC.  Lungs are clear.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of tracheostomy tube.  No  pneumomediastinum;
