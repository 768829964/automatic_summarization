                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Thick secretions from tracheostomy, please assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
 Tracheostomy tube is noted.  There has been interval removal of a right
 subclavian central venous catheter since the prior exam.  There is improved
 aeration of the lungs, most notable in the left lower lobe.  There is
 persistent linear density in the left lower lobe likely representing
 persistent atelectasis.  There is lobar consolidation, effusion, pneumothorax.
 Mild peribronchial thickening could reflect airways inflammation. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Bony structures are intact.  No free
 air below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No lobar consolidation.  Bronchial thickening could reflect
 airways inflammatory process.  Improved aeration since prior exam.
