                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post bronchoscopy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed same day 11
 hours earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates unremarkable mediastinal,
 hilar, and cardiac contours.  Lungs are clear.  Air beneath the central
 portion of the diaphragm suggests continued pneumoperitoneum.  No pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is evident.  No pneumomediastinum identified.  Right
 subclavian with tip in the distal SVC is noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Continuous evidence of pneumoperitoneum.  No pneumothorax or
 pneumomediastinum.
