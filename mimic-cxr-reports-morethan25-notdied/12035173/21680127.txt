                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PNA and intubated  // interval change     
 interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 13:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 05:46 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified. The endotracheal tube has its tip at the thoracic inlet. Lung
 volumes remain low with crowding of the pulmonary vasculature and persistent
 opacity at the left base and an associated left effusion.  There is improved
 aeration in the right mid and lower lung consistent with resolving
 atelectasis. No pulmonary edema or pneumothorax. Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are likely unchanged given differences in patient
 positioning between studies.
