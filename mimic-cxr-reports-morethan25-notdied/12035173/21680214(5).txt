                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p MVC w/ C6 fracture intubated after developing respiratory
 failure now s/p C5-C7 anterior fusion c/b neck swelling s/p takeback and
 washout; revision of anterior fusion, emergent posterior decompression fusion
 for cord compression  // s/p trach/PEG - eval position and r/o PTX
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the immediate prior study, endotracheal and enteric tubes have
 been removed and a tracheostomy has been placed, which ends 4.5 cm from the
 carina. The left-sided PICC line ends in the upper SVC. The moderate left
 pleural effusion appears to have decreased, now small, though this may be due
 to changes in positioning. The left perihilar opacity may have improved
 slightly as well. Right base consolidation continues to improve. Heart size is
 top normal and unchanged. Spinal fusion hardware projects in unchanged
 position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New tracheostomy in good position.
 2. Possible slight improvement in left-sided effusion, although this may be
 due to patient positioning.
