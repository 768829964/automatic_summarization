 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p MVC w/ C6 fracture intubated after developing respiratory
 failure now s/p C5-C7 anterior fusion c/b neck swelling s/p takeback and
 washout; revision of anterior fusion, emergent posterior decompression fusion
 for cord compression  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube tip is relatively high, 7 cm above the carinal. NG tube tip is in the
 stomach. Left subclavian line tip is at the level of superior SVC.
