                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with wheezing, hypoxia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CTA chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged, unchanged.  Patient is status
 post transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  Left upper lobe suprahilar
 opacity containing ___ fiducial markers remains grossly unchanged compared to
 the previous examination.  The hilar contours are otherwise similar.  There is
 a small left pleural effusion, not substantially changed in the interval.  The
 right lung is clear.  No pneumothorax is present.  Marked degenerative changes
 are seen in the left glenohumeral and both acromioclavicular joints.  There
 are multilevel degenerative changes also seen within the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall, no substantial interval change in appearance of the chest from prior.
 Continued ill-defined opacity in the left upper lobe compatible with known
 lesion which has undergone prior RF ablation.  Small left pleural effusion,
 similar to the previous study.
