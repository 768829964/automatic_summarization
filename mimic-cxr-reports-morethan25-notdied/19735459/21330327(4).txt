                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with trach leak, hx PNA  // Trach position? PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 AP portable upright view of the chest.   Tracheostomy tube projects over the
 superior mediastinum.  An aortic valve stent is in place.  Right upper
 extremity PICC line is seen with its tip in the lower SVC.  A feeding tube
 extends towards the left hemidiaphragm though the tip is excluded from view. 
 Clips are seen projecting over the left upper lung.  Overlying EKG leads are
 present.  There is near complete opacification of the right lung which is
 likely a combination of effusion, edema and possible pneumonia.  Patchy
 opacity in the left lung mostly in the left upper and lower lungs may also
 represent foci of infection.  Overall cardiomediastinal silhouette appears
 stable from prior.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As above.
