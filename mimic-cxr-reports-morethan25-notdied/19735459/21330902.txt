 2. CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal silhouette is accentuated due to AP technique, likely
 stable.  New since prior exam is mild pulmonary edema.  Left upper lobe
 opacities were better evaluated on prior CT chest from ___. There is
 no new superimposed focal lung consolidation.  There is no pneumothorax or
 sizable pleural effusion.  Surgical clips overlie the left upper thorax, as on
 prior exam.  Irregularity of the left upper ribs is unchanged.
