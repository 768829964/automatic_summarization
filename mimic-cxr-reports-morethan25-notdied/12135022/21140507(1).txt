                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with orogastric tube placed, check
 position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding similar study obtained nine hours earlier during the same day.  The
 patient is intubated and the ETT remains in unchanged position terminating in
 the trachea some 5 cm above the level of the carina.  Still present are the
 previously described right internal jugular central venous lines and a
 right-sided PICC line, both terminating in the mid portion of the SVC.  No
 pneumothorax can be seen.  An NG tube is identified, seen to terminate well
 below the diaphragm.  The line reaches below image field.
 
 The presence of an NG tube was already observed on the preceding examination
 obtained earlier during the day.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Stable chest findings.
