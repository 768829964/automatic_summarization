                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Hypoxic respiratory failure.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4.5 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip passes below the
 diaphragm terminating in the stomach.  Heart size is difficult to assess due
 to bilateral basal areas of consolidation in conjunction with pleural
 effusion.  As compared to the prior study obtained on ___, there
 is interval improvement of right upper lung partial atelectasis.  There is
 also slight interval decrease in pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.
