                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 425 
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old intubated, assess for endotracheal tube placement.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 442.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 427 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube has its tip approximately 4.4 cm above the carina.  A
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  Assessment of the cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult
 due to marked patient rotation on the current examination.  A right subclavian
 PICC line likely has its tip in the distal SVC.  Lung volumes are markedly
 diminished and there are layering bilateral effusions.  There is likely a
 loculated effusion or contusion overlying the left lateral chest wall where
 there are several displaced rib fractures.  The pulmonary vasculature appears
 crowded, but no overt pulmonary edema is appreciated.  No large pneumothorax
 is seen.
