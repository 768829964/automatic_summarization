                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest radiograph centered at thoracoabdominal junction was obtained
 for assessment of a nasogastric tube, which courses well below the diaphragm
 within the stomach.  Overall appearance of the chest is similar compared to
 the recent study performed several hours earlier.  Within the imaged portion
 of the abdomen, diffuse haziness is present suggesting possible ascites.
