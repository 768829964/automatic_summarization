                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Postop desaturation.
 
 There are no prior studies available for comparison.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Widening of mediastinum is likely due to
 engorgement of the mediastinal vessels.  Adenopathy cannot be totally
 excluded.  Followup when clinically appropriate with conventional PA and
 lateral views is recommended.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are largely
 on the right side.  There is mild vascular congestion.  There is bibasilar
 atelectasis.  Mild cardiomegaly is accentuated by the low lung volumes.
