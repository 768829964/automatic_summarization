 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall change
 except for less distension of the gas filled stomach.  Although the clinical
 history suggests diaphragmatic paralysis,, the possibility of diaphragmatic
 rupture should be considered.
 Monitoring and support devices remain in place with almost complete
 opacification of the left hemithorax, presumably related to lobar collapse
 related to mucous plugging.
 Little change in the appearance of the right lung.
