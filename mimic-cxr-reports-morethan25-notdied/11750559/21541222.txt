                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with free air  // eval for free air
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  No prior chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated to the left.  Tracheostomy tube is noted.  There is marked
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with concern for a left diaphragmatic
 hernia containing dilated air-filled gastrointestinal structures, likely
 stomach and possibly bowel.  Adjacent thin lucency is worrisome for
 pneumoperitoneum which was seen on outside hospital CT earlier today.  There
 is subsequent mediastinal shift to the right.  No large pleural effusion is
 seen.  No definite focal consolidation although there may be basilar
 atelectasis.
