                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 521 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with pulmonary edema, question pneumonia,
 followup.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study ___ at 842.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 521 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval resolution of the pulmonary edema.  There is persistent
 consolidative opacity in the right mid-to-lower lung and in the retrocardiac
 region.  These findings would be more concerning for aspiration or pneumonia. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  There are possibly small layering effusions.  No pneumothorax.  A
 single-lead left-sided pacer, right internal jugular central line,
 endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube are likely unchanged in position.
