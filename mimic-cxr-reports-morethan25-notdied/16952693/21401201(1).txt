                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Assess endotracheal
 tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Portable semi erect AP chest radiograph demonstrates an endotracheal tube with
 its tip terminating 4.5 cm above the level of the carina in appropriate
 position.  There is a feeding tube descending in an uncomplicated course to
 the distal esophagus, its tip out of view.  A right internal jugular line is
 seen terminating at the level of the low superior vena cava. A left pectorally
 placed pacer/defibrillator is seen with its single lead intact terminating in
 the right ventricle.  The heart size is top-normal.  There is interval
 development of pulmonary edema as demonstrated by increased interstitial fluid
 with new right small pleural effusion. The left lung is grossly clear with no
 new focal consolidations.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Early pulmonary edema with new right pleural effusion. Endotracheal tube in
 appropriate position.
