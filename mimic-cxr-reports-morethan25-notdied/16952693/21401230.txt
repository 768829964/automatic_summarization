 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with altered mental status.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs of the chest dated ___
 through ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates
 bibasilar atelectasis, significantly increased from the prior study.  There
 are low lung volumes which results in bronchovascular crowding.  Tracheostomy
 tube is 5.2 cm from the carina.  A right-sided PICC line ends at the
 cavoatrial junction.  Single-lead pacemaker is in unchanged position.  A VP
 shunt projects over the left hemithorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
  Interval increase in bibasilar atelectasis.
