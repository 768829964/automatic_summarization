                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with fever and shortness of breath.  Evaluate for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Series of radiographs, most recently from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable semi-erect view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with prior radiograph, there is progression of the
 right sided pleural opacities, particurally in the lower lobes. The
 tracheostomy tube, pacemaker wires and right subclavian line in appropriate
 and stable positions.  Heart is again enlarged.  Left lung volume loss as well
 as opacities in left upper lobe continues largely unchanged.  Left upper lobe
 consolidation is consistent with aspiration versus atelectasis.
