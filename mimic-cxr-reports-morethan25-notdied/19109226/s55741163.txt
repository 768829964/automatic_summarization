                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath, to assess for aspiration.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette with increased opacification at both bases
 consistent with substantial volume loss in the lower lungs.  Bilateral pleural
 effusions persist.  The possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be
 seriously considered given the clinical situation, and a discrete
 consolidation would be difficult to identify given the extensive changes
 within the chest.  Monitoring and support devices are unchanged, and
 dual-channel pacemaker device remains in place.
