                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT CHEST RADIOGRAPH AT 60 DEGREES.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  New right subclavian line placement.  Evaluate line
 placement.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Tracheostomy tube is again seen.  There has been interval placement of a
 right-sided subclavian central venous catheter, with the tip in the region of
 the cavoatrial junction.  There is a dual chamber cardiac pacemaker present,
 with leads as expected in position.
 
 Allowing for the lung volumes, the cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 probably within normal limits.  The left hemithorax appears unchanged since
 the prior examination, with disproportionate of volume loss of the left
 hemithorax compared with right, as well as retrocardiac opacity.  No osseous
 abnormalities are appreciated on this limited radiograph.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right central venous catheter tip is in the region of the cavoatrial
 junction. 
 
 2.  Persistent volume loss of the left hemithorax and retrocardiac opacity.
