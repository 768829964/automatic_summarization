                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with NG tube that had to be replaced, so
 he can get Gastroview.  Check position.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the lower chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  The image is under penetrated and it is impossible to
 identify the tip of the NG tube.  Observed through the lower cardiac shadow
 are the previously described dual intracavitary pacer electrodes, apparently
 in unchanged position.  Overlying EKG electrodes are external.  Similar as
 before, markedly distended large and small bowels are noted, indicating
 abnormal ileus.  P.S.  On a followup abdominal view obtained 45 minutes later,
 one can identify the NG tube in high infradiaphragmatic position, indicating
 that it is located in the stomach which, however, is markedly compressed by
 the distended bowel loops.  See separate report issued on abdominal
 examination.
