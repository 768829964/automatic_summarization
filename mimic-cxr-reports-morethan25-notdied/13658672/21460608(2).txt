                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluation of endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient was intubated. 
 The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 5.3 cm above the carina, tube must
 be advanced by 2 cm.  The course and position of the nasogastric tube is
 unchanged.  Minimal right pleural effusion with atelectasis at the right lung
 bases.  Unchanged borderline size of the cardiac silhouette without pulmonary
 edema.  Short-term followup should be performed to rule out potential
 developing pneumonia in the right lower lung.
