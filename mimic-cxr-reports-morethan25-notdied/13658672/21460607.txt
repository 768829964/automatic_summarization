                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 9:19 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with seizures and new cough, rule out infection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___.
 
 Though the heart is not grossly enlarged, it has increased in size since
 ___.  The lung volumes are now lower, but I do not think this explains
 the discrepancy.  While there is no pleural effusion, this does raise the
 possibility of pericardial effusion.  Pulmonary vasculature is normal.  Lungs
 are grossly clear.  Dr. ___ was paged at 12:30 p.m.
