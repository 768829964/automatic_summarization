                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Epilepsy, new high fever, rule out pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased, likely as a result of poor inspiration.  As a consequence, the
 crowding of the vascular structures, notably at the lung bases, is increased
 compared to previously.  However, coexisting mild fluid overload might be
 present.  No overt pulmonary edema.  Borderline size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  No pleural effusions.
 
 A lateral radiograph might be helpful for further evaluation.
