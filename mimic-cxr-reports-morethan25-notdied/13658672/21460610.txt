 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:01 PM
  Small opacity projecting just lateral to left heart border may represent early
  pneumonia, not definitely seen on prior studies.  Recommend continued close
  follow up radiographs.
  
 WET READ VERSION #1 
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated for status epilepticus with fever, rule out pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, 1 VW
 
 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position 2.1 cm above the carina. 
 Vertical linear lucency along the right side of the trachea is thought to
 represent an artifact due to projection of the right lateral wall of the
 trachea immediately adjacent to, but beyond, the right side of the vertebral
 bodies.  There is vague patchy opacity in the left mid zone adjacent to the
 left heart border -- the possibility of an early pneumonic infiltrate or focus
 of aspiration cannot be excluded.  Minimal atelectasis at the left base.  Mild
 prominence of the right perihilar markings is also seen, similar to the film
 obtained on ___ at 13:34 p.m.  No overt CHF or effusion. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for technique without
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1) ET tube in satisfactory position.  
 2) New vague opacity left mid zone, ? early infiltrate or focus of aspiration.
 3) Mild stranding about right hilum.  Attention to this area on followup films
 is recommended.
