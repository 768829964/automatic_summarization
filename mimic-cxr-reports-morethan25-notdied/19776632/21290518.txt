 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p presumed assault with multiple facial fx, elevated OS IOP
 s/p lateral canthotomy, intubated for airway protection, now with pneumonia
 now s/p cerebellar burr hole for hematoma evacuation and L.EVD placement s/p
 trach ___  // interval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Portable chest film
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs dating back to ___

 prominent as compared to prior. The right lower lung opacity is less
 prominent. There has been interval removal of the NG tube and left subclavian
 line.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Air under the right hemidiaphragm likely related to recent instrumentation.
 Left upper lung opacity is more prominent while the right lower lung opacity
 abutting the hemidiaphragm is slightly improved.
