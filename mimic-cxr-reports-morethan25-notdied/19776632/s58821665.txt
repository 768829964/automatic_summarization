                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with tachypnea  // acute process?      acute
 process?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study ___ at 05:46
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ at 16 59 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position.  The bilateral diffuse parenchymal
 opacities with more confluent consolidation in the left upper lobe and at the
 right base do not appear to be significantly changed. There is some prominence
 of the interstitium peripherally in the right lung but this also does not
 appear to be changed. No large effusions and no pneumothorax. Overall cardiac
 and mediastinal contours are likely stable given marked patient rotation to
 the left.
