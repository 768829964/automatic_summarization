                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___M transferred from ___ s/p assumed assault now s/p cerebellar
 burr hole for hematoma evacuation  and L. EVD placement ___Numerous injuries
 including depressed skull fx, small SDH, multiple facial fractures  //
 Evaluate interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable frontal view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube terminates at midline. Bilateral diffuse parenchymal
 opacities have improved with more confluent consolidation seen at the left
 upper lobe and right lung base.  No large pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 identified. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent improvement of diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities.
