                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p assault with multiple facial fractures,
 vomited x___ yesterday, now with slight desaturation.  // R/o pneumonia,
 aspiration pneumonitis
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Progressive opacification right lung base could be due in part to pleural
 effusion, but is more likely pulmonary. In the absence of clear rightward
 mediastinal shift, this is probably due to worsening right lower lobe
 pneumonia. Lungs are otherwise clear of focal abnormality. Heart size
 top-normal has increased slightly, and pulmonary vasculature is more dilated
 but there is no pulmonary edema.  ET tube tip is between 2 and 3 cm above
 carinal with the chin elevated and should be withdrawn 15 mm for optimal
 placement.  Esophageal drainage tube ends in nondistended stomach.
 
 No pneumothorax or appreciable left pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr ___ by telephone on
 ___ at 11:10AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.
