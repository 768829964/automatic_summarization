                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CTA chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs are hyperinflated.  There are coarse bilateral
 interstitial markings, most predominant in the periphery and the bases.  This
 is consistent with the patient's history of emphysema related fibrosis.  The
 interstital changes limit the evaluation of the underlying parenchyma, but
 there is no definite evidence of consolidations, edema, pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The patient is status post a median sternotomy.  The sternal
 wires are intact.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Chronic interstitial lung disease and emphysema. Evaluation of the underlying
 parenchyma is limited, but no acute cardiopulmonary process is present.
