                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Weakness and cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs and CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral views.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is status post sternotomy and coronary artery bypass graft
 surgery.  The heart is normal in size.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 appear within normal limits.  The left lung now appears clear with resolution
 of pulmonary edema and pleural effusion on the right.  There is persistent
 opacification, particularly posteriorly, suggesting a pleural effusion of
 small to moderate size on the right, potentially with some loculation. 
 Associated residual atelectasis is likely but substantially improved. There is
 also a more generalized persistent right-sided interstitial abnormality but
 markedly reduced.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Marked improvement in pleural effusions and pulmonary edema but with
 persistent right-sided effusion, potentially with some loculation and residual
 unilateral interstitial abnormality.  Short-term follow-up with chest CT is
 recommended to reassess previously noted nodular opacities.
