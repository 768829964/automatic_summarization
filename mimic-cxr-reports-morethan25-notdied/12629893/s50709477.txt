                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with known COPD and interstitial lung disease, now
 with shortness of breath.  
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in an upright position.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Compared to the prior exam, there is increased interstitial abnormality
 concerning for edema.  More consolidative opacity is seen in the right lung. 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with known emphysema.  Heart and
 mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Sternal wires are noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Increased interstitial abnormality diffusely, which could be secondary to
 edema.  Concomitant right parenchymal opacity, which could represent
 pneumonia.  Underlying COPD and fibrosis.
