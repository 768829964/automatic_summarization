 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with interstitial lung
 disease, congestive heart failure after arrest and intubation.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___ obtained at 10:26 a.m.
 
 The ET tube tip is approximately 10 cm above the carina and should be further
 advanced.  Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.  There is interval
 improvement of pulmonary edema which is still at least moderate, interstitial.
 Bilateral pleural effusions are present.  Bibasal areas of atelectasis are
 noted, overall slightly improved since the prior study.
