                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  COPD, interstitial lung disease, crackles in the right lower lobe.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT and chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The patient is status post median sternotomy and CABG.  The lungs are
 hyperinflated with flattening of the diaphragms compatible with emphysema. 
 The heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged. 
 Increased interstitial opacities are seen diffusely, with more focal confluent
 opacity seen within the right peripheral mid lung field.  Coarsened
 interstitial markings are also seen predominantly at the lung bases and along
 the periphery compatible with known pulmonary fibrosis.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is demonstrated.  No new areas of focal consolidation
 clearly noted. There are no acute osseous abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Little interval change compared to the previous radiograph with no new areas
 of focal consolidation seen.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema superimposed
 on a background of chronic interstitial lung disease with evidence of severe
 emphysema and fibrosis.  Previously described regions of either multifocal
 pneumonia or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia seen on prior CT are not as well
 assessed on this radiograph.
