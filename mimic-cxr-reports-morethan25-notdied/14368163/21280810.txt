                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  Mr. ___ ia a ___ year-old man with a Hx of AML s/p allo-SCT
 (Day 605+), GVHD of the skin and liver on home Cellcept + Hydrocortisone and
 CAD s/p CABG X 5 who is readmitted after discharge from ___ on ___
 with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure of unclear etiology but most
 concerning for an infectious process.  // interval assessment
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 11:46 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy and right IJ central line tip overlying distal SVC again noted. 
 No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar, with sternotomy wires noted.
 
 Again seen is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring.  There
 is a small left lower effusion with patchy opacity at the left lung base,
 possibly slightly worse.  The differential could include a pneumonic
 infiltrate.  There is minimal atelectasis at the right base, slightly more
 pronounced in the right cardiophrenic region, similar to the prior study.  No
 gross right effusion.
 
 On today's exam, there is a balloon overlying the right upper quadrant,
 presumably representing a G-tube.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy opacity at the left base, overall similar the prior study, the possibly
 slightly worse.  Differential diagnosis includes an infectious infiltrate.
 
 Patchy stranding at the right base, likely atelectasis.  Early infiltrate is
 considered less likely but cannot be entirely excluded.
 
 Mild upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring is consistent
 with CHF, similar to the prior study.
