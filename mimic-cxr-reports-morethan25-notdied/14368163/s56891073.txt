                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation, in a patient with hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from approximately 1 hour prior on the same day.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Frontal chest radiographs demonstrate interval placement of an endotracheal
 tube, which terminates in the mid thoracic trachea.  On initial radiographs,
 an enteric tube is seen terminating within the right lower bronchus. 
 Subsequent radiographs demonstrate removal of the enteric tube.  There are
 increasing opacities bilaterally, consistent with edema, aspiration, or a
 combination of the two.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval intubation, with the endotracheal tube terminating in the mid
 thoracic trachea.
 2. Increasing bilateral opacities, consistent with edema, aspiration, or a
 combination of the two.
