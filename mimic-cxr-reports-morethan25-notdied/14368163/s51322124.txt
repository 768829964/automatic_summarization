                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with bilateral opacities. Evaluate interval
 change.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube, enteric tube, and right-sided central venous line are
 unchanged.  Cardiomegaly and moderate pulmonary edema has worsened, however
 the increased bilateral parenchymal abnormalities while partially due to
 worsening edema, also likely reflect widespread disseminated infection.  No
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing bilateral pulmonary opacification in part secondary to worsening
 edema, although likely reflect widespread infection.
