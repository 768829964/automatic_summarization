                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ M w/ SAH in basal cisterns, IVH w/hydrocephalus. S/P EVD
 (___). Repeat CTA w/concern for left vertebral artery dissection.  //
 interval change     interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  No comparisons.  Please note that comparison to old studies can
 be helpful to detect subtle interval change.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi supine chest radiograph ___ at 05:03 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube has the tip 4.4 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is
 seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip projecting over the proximal
 stomach and the side port at or just below the gastroesophageal junction. The
 heart is upper limits of normal in size given portable technique.  Lungs
 appear well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.  No pleural effusions or pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax,
 although the sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi
 supine technique.
