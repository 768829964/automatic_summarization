                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with respiratory failure, intubated  // please
 assess for ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable, AP upright radiograph view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT tip projects approximately 2.5 cm the carina with the neck in neutral
 position.  Right IJ catheter tip projects over the expected region of the
 upper SVC, unchanged.  Left IJ catheter tip projects over the expected region
 of the mid SVC, also unchanged.  Enteric tube traverses the diaphragm and left
 upper quadrant and its tip is beyond the scope of this image.  Other lines are
 external to the patient.  The patient is rotated.
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Interval increase in left perihilar opacity is
 concerning for developing pneumonia.  Interval increase in left lower lung
 opacity, most likely reflecting combination of increased atelectasis and size
 of the moderate left pleural effusion.  Increased right pleural effusion.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ETT 2.5 cm from carina.
 2.  Interval increase in left perihilar opacity is concerning for developing
 pneumonia.
 3. Interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephoneon ___ at 10:29 AM, 15 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
