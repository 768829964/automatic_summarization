                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with PNA, respiratory failure, intubated  // Eval
 for ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph obtained earlier on the same date.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior study the patient has been intubated, an endotracheal tube
 terminates 4.5 cm above the level carina.  A nasogastric tube terminates in
 the stomach.  Lung volumes are within normal limits.  No pneumothorax seen. 
 Predominate perihilar airspace opacities are consistent with pulmonary edema,
 asymmetric with increased opacity seen in the left lung. Infection or
 hemorrhage cannot be excluded.  Left lower lobe atelectasis.  There is a small
 left pleural effusion.
