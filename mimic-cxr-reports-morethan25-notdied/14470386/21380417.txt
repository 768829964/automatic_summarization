                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  DX CHEST PORT LINE/TUBE PLCMT 2 EXAMS
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old male with history polysubstance abuse and Hepatitis
 C, admitted to ___ after trauma of unclear etiology s/p r craniotomy for
 large epidural hematoma with midline shift. Now with R PCA infarct,
 ventilator-associated pneumonia.  // NJ tube placement   NJ tube placement
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, this and placement of a
 Dobhoff tube that extends to the upper stomach with the opaque tip well below
 the esophagogastric junction.  Other monitoring and support devices are
 unchanged.  Areas of increased opacification are again seen the bilaterally,
 though less prominent.  Some of this probably represents improved pulmonary
 vascular status.  Again, bilateral aspiration pneumonia should be seriously
 considered.
