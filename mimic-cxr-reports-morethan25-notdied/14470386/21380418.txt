 ends close to the superior cavoatrial junction.  Feeding tube ends in the
 upper stomach.  12:31.
 
 Compared to ___ mediastinal and pulmonary vessels are more engorged
 indicating a definite component of volume overload or cardiac decompensation. 
 Bibasilar consolidation preceded the relative cardiac decompensation and has
 subsequently improved.  I can't distinguish between concurrent bibasilar
