 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:52 AM
  
  
  Comparison is made to prior radiograph dated 1 day prior.  A left PICC
  terminates in the mid mid SVC.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
  stable.  Lungs are better inflated relative to prior study.  Streaky opacity
  at the left lung base may reflect atelectasis.  Blunting of the costophrenic
  angle suggests pleural effusion.  There is no pneumothorax.
