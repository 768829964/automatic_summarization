                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with draino ingestion, now s/p total gastrectomy
 and spit fistula  // ETT position     ETT position
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___:22.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lung volumes are lower and yet generalized pulmonary opacification has
 improved, accompanied by decrease in persistent pulmonary vascular and
 mediastinal venous distension.  This represents some improvement in cardiac
 function of volume overload.  Moderate cardiomegaly persists.
 
 There is still more severe opacification in the right midlung.  Whether this
 is fissural pleural fluid or focal consolidation due to pneumonia is
 radiographically indeterminate.  Leftward mediastinal shift suggests that left
 lower lobe consolidation is largely atelectasis.
 
 ET tube and midline drain still in place.  No pneumothorax.
