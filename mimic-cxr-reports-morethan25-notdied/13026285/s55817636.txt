                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M lye ingestion s/p gastrectomy/esophogostomy now s/p washout,
 bilateral chest tube placement, trach  // effusion/ptx     effusion/ptx
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the endotracheal tube
 has been removed and replaced with a tracheostomy tube, which appears well
 positioned with no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  The left
 hemidiaphragm is not well seen, consistent with some volume loss and fluid at
 the left base.  There are now bilateral chest tubes with no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  The right hemidiaphragm is indistinct, suggesting some small
 pleural effusion and atelectasis on this side as well.
