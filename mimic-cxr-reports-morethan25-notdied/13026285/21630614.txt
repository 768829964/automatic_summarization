                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with lye ingestion s/p gastrectomy and multiple
 tracheo-esophageal dilations by ENT, now s/p thoracoabdominal esophagectomy
 with esophagojejunostomy.  // interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to ___, a left chest tube remains in place with a persistent
 very small left apical pneumothorax.  Pneumoperitoneum persists and is likely
 related to recent surgery.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis has slightly decreased in extent, and small bilateral pleural
 effusions are a persistent finding.
