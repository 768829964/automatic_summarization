                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M status post chest tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 10:37
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal and enteric tubes remain in unchanged positions.  There has been
 interval placement of a left basilar chest tube.  There is continued near
 complete opacification of the left hemi thorax with probable leftward shift of
 mediastinal structures suggestive of atelectasis/collapse.  Patchy opacity in
 the right lung base also likely reflects an area of atelectasis.  No overt
 pulmonary edema or large pneumothorax is present.  Known fractures of the
 right anterior ribs are not well assessed on the current radiograph
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval placement of left basilar chest tube.  Otherwise no substantial
 interval change in the near complete opacification of left hemithorax likely
 related to atelectasis/collapse.
