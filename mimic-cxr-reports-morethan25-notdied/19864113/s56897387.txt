 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man on VV ECMO  // eval left chest      eval left
 chest
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  There has been substantial aeration of the left mid
 and upper zones with residual opacification at the bases consistent with some
 combination of pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower lobe. Pleural
 effusion and volume loss at the right lower lobe lung is again seen.
