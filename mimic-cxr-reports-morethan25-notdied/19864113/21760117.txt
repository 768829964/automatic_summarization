                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p MVC with right ___ and left ___th rib fractures,
 descending thoracic aorta pseudoaneurysm, and severe hypoxemic respiratory
 failure requiring 2-week long course of ECMO now s/p decannulation (___)
 and still requiring high ventilatory settings   support for adequate
 oxygenation.  // Intubated; interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The support apparatus is unchanged and in good position.  Scattered areas of
 basal atelectasis have slightly improved and right lower lobe.  Left lower
 lobe collapse has improved post streaky and subsegmental atelectasis. 
 Interval enlargement of bilateral hila could represent mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  There is a small left pleural effusion, slightly increased.  No
 pneumothorax.  The heart is not significantly enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval enlargement of bilateral hila could represent mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion.
 
 Interval improvement of bibasal atelectasis, left greater than right.
