                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with ARDS  // interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT appears to be high terminating 8 cm above the carina, which is
 unchanged in comparison to the prior radiograph.  There is a left PICC line
 with the tip terminating in the low SVC.  There is a right IJ ECMO cannula,
 which appears unchanged in comparison to the prior radiograph.
 
 There is improved aeration of the lower lobes bilaterally, although there is a
 persistent combination of bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  The upper lungs appear clear bilaterally.  The mediastinal and
 hilar contours are normal.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  ET tube continues to be high.  PICC line and ECMO cannula in appropriate
 positioning.
 2.  Improving bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
