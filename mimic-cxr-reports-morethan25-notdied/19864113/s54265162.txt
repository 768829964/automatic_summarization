                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man on ECMO  // follow up edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 An endotracheal tube is in-situ, the tip remains relatively high in position
 approximately 8 cm above the level of the carina, this could be advanced for
 more stable positioning.  A nasogastric tube is in-situ, the tip is not
 clearly visualized on this study but appears to be below the left
 hemidiaphragm.  A large bore catheter projects over the right side mediastinum
 and along the right heart border, this is unchanged in appearance and
 consistent with an ECMO catheter.  This appears to extend into the IVC.  Left
 basilar atelectasis with an adjacent left chest drain, a side hole of the
 chest strain is close to the chest wall, this could be advanced.  Right
 basilar atelectasis also noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. No significant interval change when compared to the prior study.
 2. A left-sided chest drain is unchanged in position except note that a side
 hole is very close to the chest wall and the catheter drain be advanced for
 more secure seating.
 3. The endotracheal tube remains high in position above the level of the
 carina.
