                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with MVC, intubated
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso obtained at outside institution ___ at 06:39
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4 cm from the carina.  An
 enteric tube tip courses below the left hemidiaphragm with tip off the
 inferior borders of the film.  Near total opacification of the left hemithorax
 is new and concerning for left lung atelectasis/collapse.  The heart size is
 difficult to assess given the near complete opacification of the left hemi
 thorax, though minimal visualization of the right heart border suggests that
 there may be minimal leftward shift of mediastinal structures.  Patchy
 opacities in the right lung base reflect areas of atelectasis.  No large
 pneumothorax is demonstrated.  The extreme right lateral chest is excluded
 from the field of view.  Previously seen right anterior rib fractures are not
 evident on the current exam.  Cervical spinal fusion hardware is incompletely
 assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Endotracheal and enteric tubes in standard positions.
 2.  Near complete opacification of the left hemithorax most likely due to left
 lung atelectasis/collapse.
 3.  Right basilar atelectasis.  Known right-sided rib fractures are better
 assessed on the previous CT.
