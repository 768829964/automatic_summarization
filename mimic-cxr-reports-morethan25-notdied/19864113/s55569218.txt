 persists in the left lower lobe.  Any paraspinal hematoma in that location
 would be obscured by the atelectasis.  Indwelling left basal pleural drain
 unchanged in position.  Left pleural effusion small if any.  No pneumothorax. 
 Mild right upper lobe atelectasis improved.  Normal cardiomediastinal
 silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
 
 ET tube and left subclavian line are in standard placements and a nasogastric
 tube loops in nondistended stomach.
