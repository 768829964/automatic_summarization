                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of pericardial effusion and VATS status post
 pericardiocentesis.  Please evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, most
 recently performed on the same day at 8:15 a.m.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube terminates approximately 5.5 cm above the carina. 
 There is an enteric tube which courses below the diaphragm with the tip out of
 view from this radiograph.  The heart is again severely enlarged overall
 stable compared to the prior exam. The massively enlarged triangular cardiac
 silhouette appears overall unchanged compared to the prior radiograph in
 morphology.  There appears to be slight interval improvement in the
 opacification over the right lung suggestive of mild interval improvement of
 the large right pleural effusion.  The left lung base consolidation appears to
 be stable compared to the prior exam.  The small left pleural effusion is
 unchanged.  The degree of bilateral pulmonary edema is constant.  There is no
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Overall, slight interval improvement of the extensive right pleural effusion. 
 Stable left lung base consolidation, likely secondary to atelectasis, however,
 an acute infectious process cannot be excluded.
