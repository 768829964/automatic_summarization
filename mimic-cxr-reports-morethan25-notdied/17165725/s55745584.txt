                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Right lobe empyema, asses tube placement.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 There has been marked decrease in size in right hydropneumothorax / empyema. 
 Right basal catheter remains in place.  Right lower lobe consolidation has
 also improved.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with widened
 mediastinum and cardiomegaly.  ET tube is in standard position.  Right
 supraclavicular catheter tip is in the right atrium.  Left lower lobe
 opacities are unchanged.  There is probably a small left effusion.
