                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with MSSA bacteremia, evaluate for pneumonia,
 pulmonary edema, cardiac silhouette.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Cardiac silhouette continues to be severely enlarged with unchanged mild fluid
 overload.  Bilateral hemidiaphragms are obscured likely representing
 atelectasis and pleural effusion.  No focal consolidation or pneumothorax is
 seen.  The right IJ line is in stable position in the mid to upper SVC.  The
 left IJ line ends at the junction with the brachiocephalic vein.  ET tube is
 in appropriate position.  Gastric tube traverses past the diaphragm and coils
 in the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Severe cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema is unchanged.  Bibasilar atelectasis
 and pleural effusions likely.  No focal pneumonia seen.
