                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pericardial effusion bilateral pleural effusions and ventilator
 associated pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph single-view.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The endotracheal tube remains in position with tip 5 cm cranial to the carina.
 A right internal jugular central venous catheter terminates in the mid SVC.  A
 left internal jugular introducer remains at the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic.  An upper enteric tube passes through the upper stomach and
 outside of the field of imaging.  The cardiac silhouette remains massively
 enlarged but not significantly changed compared to prior study despite
 pericardial drainage catheter remaining in place though quite improved
 compared to ___.  Layering right-greater-than-left pleural effusions are
 unchanged in volume.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild to moderate pulmonary
 edema is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Overall no significant change compared to prior examination with persistent
 massive enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, mild pulmonary edema and
 bilateral layering pleural effusions.
