                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pleural effusion, here to evaluate for
 interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT chest dated ___ and prior chest radiograph dated
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right PICC terminates over the right axilla.  There is interval
 development of a large air loculation in the right lung base with an air-fluid
 level, significantly progressed from the prior CT of ___ and chest
 radiograph of ___.  There is surrounding opacification of the
 right lower lobe, which may reflect compressive atelectasis or superimposed
 infection.  Pleural fluid is also seen tracking along the lateral wall of the
 right hemithorax.  There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial
 edema.  The cardiomediastinal contours are incompletely evaluated in the
 setting of the right basilar collection, but appear grossly stable.  A right
 internal jugular hemodialysis catheter is unchanged in position with the tip
 likely projecting over the right atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval development of right posterior basal loculated air-fluid
 collection, significantly progressed from chest CT of ___. 
 Surrounding lung opacification may represent compressive atelectasis or
 superimposed infection.
 2.  Pleural fluid extending along the right lateral wall of the hemithorax
 could represent loculated fluid.
 3.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion/interstitial edema.
 4.  Right PICC with tip projecting over the axilla.  Recommend repositioning.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings communicated by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ ___
 interventional pulmonology via telephone at 4:45pm on ___.
