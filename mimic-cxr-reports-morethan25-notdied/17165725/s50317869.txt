 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 9:47 PM
  Bilateral internal jugular catheters unchanged.  Severe cardiomegaly is
  slightly worse than prior.  Further obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm is
  thought to reflect a combination of both atelectasis and increasing pleural
  effusion.  Small left pleural effusion increased as well.  No pneumothorax.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Intubation, evaluation for endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 12:28 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the bilateral internal
 jugular vein catheters are unchanged.  There is severe cardiomegaly and mild
 fluid overload, minimally increased since the previous exam.  Unchanged
 blunting of the right hemidiaphragm, likely caused by the presence of
 atelectasis and pleural effusion.  A small left pleural effusion is also
 present, slightly worsened since the previous examination.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The newly placed endotracheal tube projects 4.3 cm above the
 carina.
