                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis, to assess for pneumonia and pulmonary edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again huge
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with only mild elevation of pulmonary
 venous pressure.  Specifically, no evidence of acute pneumonia.  However, the
 substantial area behind the heart cannot be properly evaluated in the absence
 of a lateral view.
 
 There has been placement of a right IJ catheter that extends to the
 mid-to-lower portion of the SVC.
