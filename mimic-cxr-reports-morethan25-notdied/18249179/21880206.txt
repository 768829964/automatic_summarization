                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with seizure disorder and now with hypoxic
 respiratory failure.  Failed extubation yesterday and required emergent
 re-intubation.  // Interval changes.     Interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 09:30
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest radiograph ___ at 10:05 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian PICC line, VP shunt, endotracheal tube, and feeding tube are
 unchanged in position.  The heart remains markedly enlarged which may reflect
 cardiomegaly, although pericardial effusion should also be considered.  Lung
 volumes are low with layering bilateral effusions and patchy bibasilar
 opacities suggestive of atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely
 excluded.  No obvious pneumothorax.  An IVC filter is incompletely visualized.
