                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with trach, on vent  // interval changes
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy is in-situ, unchanged in appearance compared to the prior
 study.  Lung volumes are low, this limits assessment.  A right-sided PICC
 terminates in the mid to distal SVC.  A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is
 incompletely visualized.  An IVC filter is seen in the upper abdomen.  A
 gastrostomy tube is incompletely visualized.
 
 Even allowing for the projection, the heart is enlarged.  Bilateral airspace
 opacities are again seen.  This is more confluent in the right upper lobe than
 on the prior study.  Appearances remain concerning for infection.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Airspace opacity now appears more confluent in the right upper lobe. 
 Bilateral airspace opacities persist.  Otherwise, no significant interval
 change.
