  consistent with aspiration or infection.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with inbuated seizure  // Eval ETT
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP view
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A VP shunt projects over the right hemithorax.  An endotracheal tube ends
 approximately of 1 cm above the carina and should be pulled back 2.0 cm for
 more standard positioning.  An enteric tube courses below the level of the
 diaphragm and coils in the stomach.  There is a consolidation in the right
 upper lobe.  There is no pneumothorax.  Enlargement of cardiac silhouette may
 reflect cardiomegaly and or pericardial effusion.  .  Osseous structures are
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  An endotracheal tube ends 1 cm above the carina.  Recommend withdrawal for
 standard positioning.
 
 2.  A consolidation in the right upper lobe may be consistent with aspiration
 or infection.  Bilateral perihilar and basilar opacities may reflect edema and
 or aspiration.
