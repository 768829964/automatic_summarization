                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with trach, increased secretions and
 leukocytosis  // interval change, r/o acute process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with the prior study, there may have been slight interval improvement
 in the bilateral alveolar opacities. A right subclavian central line projects
 over the upper right atrium, slightly more distal than on the prior study.
 
 Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen is the
 tracheostomy. An additional line courses over the right neck, right
 mediastinum, and visualized portion of the right upper abdomen, unchanged --
 this apparently represents a VP shunt.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right subclavian line tip projecting over upper right atrium, slightly more
 distal on the prior study.  Clinical correlation requested.

 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Right subclavian line tip projecting over upper right
 atrium, slightly more distal on the prior study.  Clinical correlation
