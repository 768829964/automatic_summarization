                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with trach, inc. SOB  // eval for consolidation
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph is somewhat difficult to evaluate
 secondary to blurring of the image, presumably related to patient motion.  A
 tracheostomy terminates in the upper thoracic trachea.  The right approach
 PICC terminates in the mid SVC.  The exam is largely unchanged, with somewhat
 low lung volumes exaggerating the cardiac silhouette and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  No new focal consolidation is identified.  There is no
 appreciable pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  The visualized upper abdomen is
 unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No new focal consolidation, though evaluation is difficult secondary to
 blurring of the image, presumably related to motion.
