                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: Polytrauma.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change. 
 Bilateral chest tubes without definite pneumothorax.  The questioned deep
 sulcus sign at the left base is not readily apparent, suggesting that this may
 have been an artifact rather than representing anterior pneumothorax.
