 INDICATION:  Chest tube placed on water seal.  Evaluate for reaccumulation of
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest
 radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Pneumoperitoneum persists, more readily evident on upright images. 
 The tracheostomy tube tip is approximately 3.7 cm from the carina and abuts
 the tracheal wall.  A right internal jugular central venous catheter ends in
 the mid SVC.  Two right chest tubes are unchanged in appearance.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Persistent right basilar atelectasis is unchanged.  A left
 pleural effusion and associated atelectasisare stable but accentuated by low
 lung volumes and positioning.  Mild vascular congestion and interstitial edema
 persist.  Moderate enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 unchanged.
   
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pneumothorax.
 2.  Tracheostomy tube tip abuts the tracheal wall.
 3.  Persistent pneumoperitoneum.
 4.  Stable left pleural effusion and bilateral atelectasis.
 5.  Stable mild pulmonary edema
