                                 FINAL REPORT
 RADIOGRAPHS OF THE CHEST AND PELVIS.
 
 INDICATIONS:  Trauma.
 
 COMPARISONS: None.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Chest and pelvis, single AP view of each.  
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated.  A orogastric tube courses into the
 stomach, its distal extent not visualized.  The mediastinum is widened,
 including about the periaortic region.  A chest tube terminates in the right
 hemithorax.  There is potentially a small pneumothorax on the right.  There is
 extensive retrocardiac opacity in the left lower lobe which may be due to
 partial collapse of the left lower lobe.  Pleural effusions are difficult to
 exclude, particularly on the left, but not explicitly demonstrated. 
 Substantial subcutaneous emphysema about the course of the right-sided chest
 tube is noted along the right lateral chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Perhaps trace residual right-sided pneumothorax, although evaluation is
 limited on an AP portable supine view such as this.
 
 2.  Chest tube in situ on the right.
 
 3.  Widening of the mediastinum for which CT evaluation is indicated
 (apparently already performed at an outside institution).
