                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 1:36 A.M.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Reassess chest tube position.
 
 Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 20:50.
 
 Single portable supine chest film ___ at 1:36 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval pullback of the right chest tube which now has its tip overlying the
 right mid lung, but the side port now projects over the lateral ribs and
 subcutaneous tissues.  Advancement of 1-2 cm would be advised.  This
 recommendation was called to the patient's nurse, ___, on ___ at 10:05
 a.m. who states that the housestaff are aware.  There is persistent layering
 right effusion and layering left effusion with more focal persistent airspace
 consolidation in the left base with associated air bronchograms.  Although
 this may represent compressive atelectasis, basilar pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.  Linear opacity in the left mid lung persists and likely reflects
 subsegmental atelectasis.  There is also likely mild vascular congestion.  The
 tracheostomy tube and right subclavian central line are unchanged in position.
 Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable given differences
 in positioning between studies.  The evaluation for pneumothorax is limited
 given supine technique.
