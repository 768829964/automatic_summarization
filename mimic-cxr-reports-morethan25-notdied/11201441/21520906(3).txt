                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral chest tubes remain in place, with no visible
 pneumothorax.  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are similar in
 position with endotracheal tube terminating about 2.4 cm above the carina. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged.  Bibasilar atelectasis is again
 demonstrated, slightly worse on the right, but improving on the left.  Small
 pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
