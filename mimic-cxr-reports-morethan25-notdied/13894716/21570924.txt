                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p cardiac arrest, started on CRRT, remains
 intubated  // Interval change?
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Allowing for differences in positioning, the ET tube NG tube and 2 right IJ
 lines are probably similar in position.  Again seen is mild to moderate
 cardiomegaly and CHF with vascular plethora an interstitial edema.  Small
 amount of alveolar edema would be difficult to exclude.  Retrocardiac opacity
 consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is unchanged.
 
 There is increased hazy density over the right over lower half of the right
 lung and to some degree at the left base.  I suspect this reflects layering
 pleural effusions.  Presence of progressed collapse and/or consolidation at
 the right base laterally cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Lines and tubes essentially unchanged.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly without significant change.
 
 CHF with interstitial and probably some degree of alveolar edema.
 
 Persistent left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.
 
 Hazy density at right greater left bases is suggestive of layering pleural
 effusions, more pronounced than on the prior film.
 
 Possibility of new collapse and/or consolidation at the right base laterally
 cannot be excluded.
