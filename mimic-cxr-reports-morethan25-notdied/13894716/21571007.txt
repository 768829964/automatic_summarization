                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with intubation  // et tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right internal jugular tunneled dialysis catheter is unchanged in position
 compared to the prior study.  A right internal jugular vascular access
 catheter is also unchanged.  In the interval since the prior study the
 tracheostomy has been removed in obtained for an endotracheal tube.  The tip
 is positioned approximately 3.5 cm above the level the carina.  There is a
 veil like opacity over the right lung likely representing a layering pleural
 effusion, this appears to have increased slightly in size compared to the
 prior study.  Left lower lobe atelectasis persists.  Mild to moderate
 pulmonary edema again noted.  Moderate cardiomegaly.  No pneumothorax seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Probable mild increase in the right-sided pleural effusion.
