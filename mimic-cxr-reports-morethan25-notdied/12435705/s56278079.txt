                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with new oxygen requirement s/p craniectomy with
 abscess debridement  // Please evaluate for new areas of consolidation or
 pulmonary edema that could explain oxygen requirement
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the lateral radiograph shows new small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  In addition, there is a zone of increased
 radiodensity in the retrocardiac lung regions, likely reflecting retrocardiac
 atelectasis. However, given the clinical presentation of the patient,
 developing pneumonia cannot be excluded.  A short term repeat frontal and
 lateral radiograph should be performed.
 
 Mild cardiomegaly without pulmonary edema.  The left central venous access
 line is unchanged.
