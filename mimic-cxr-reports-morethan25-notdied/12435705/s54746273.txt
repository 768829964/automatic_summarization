                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with fever and abdominal pain.  Assess for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___ and concurrent CT abdomen and
 pelvis from ___ at 13:19.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Minimal basilar opacities are better
 characterized on concurrent CT and are consistent with atelectasis.  No
 confluent consolidation is identified to suggest pneumonia.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  No pulmonary edema or pleural effusions are identified. 
 Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Minimal bibasilar atelectasis, though no evidence of pneumonia.
