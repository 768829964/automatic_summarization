 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right subclavian artery avulsion, status post bypass graft and
 multiple orthopedic injuries.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 9:59 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the left lung shows
 unchanged evidence of a small pneumothorax.  A pre-existing pneumothorax on
 the right has decreased in extent, its lateral aspect is no longer visible,
 only its apical aspect is seen.  
 The monitoring and support devices, including the bilateral chest tubes are
 constant.  Constant size of the cardiac silhouette.  Constant appearance of
 the lung parenchyma, with, however, minimal increase in atelectasis at the
 right lung bases.
