                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Chest tube removal, assess for pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.
 
 Small left apical pneumothorax is newly appearing by radiograph but was seen
 in prior CT.  Tiny right apical pneumothorax is unchanged.  Left chest tube
 has been removed.  Other lines and tubes remain in place, in unchanged
 position.  Small right pleural effusion and multifocal lung opacities are
 unchanged.
