                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:___ ___ ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man with a tracheostomy and multiple broken ribs. 
 Recent pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to chest radiographs since ___, most
 recently ___, 5:___ a.m.:
 
 Left apical pneumothorax is tiny if any, apical pleural tube still in place.
 Left lower lobe consolidation has been present since at least ___,
 presumably atelectasis, there is new heterogeneous opacification in the left
 mid lung zone concerning for pneumonia.  There has also been an increase in
 pulmonary vascular congestion since ___, indicating a relative cardiac
 dysfunction reflected in wider mediastinum due to engorged central veins.  The
 loculated right pleural or extrapleural abnormality along the lateral chest
 wall may be slightly bigger, or exaggerated by lower lung volumes.  Greater
 consolidation in the right lower lung zone and the new findings on the left
 could be either pneumonia or worsening atelectasis.
 
 Right pleural tube is unchanged in position crossing the right lower chest
 obliquely; a torso CT on ___ showed this was posterior to the lung in the
 pleural space, not fissural.  Feeding tube ends in the stomach.  Right PIC
 line ends in the low SVC.
