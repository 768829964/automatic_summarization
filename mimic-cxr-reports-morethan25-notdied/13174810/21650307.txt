 CHEST
 
 HISTORY:  Trauma.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is dense retrocardiac opacity
 compatible with volume loss/infiltrate/effusion.  There is new tracheostomy
 tube in good location.  Left-sided chest tube is again visualized.  There is a
 small left apical pneumothorax.  The fractured left first and second ribs are
 again visualized.  The right IJ line, right chest tube, right lateral
 pleural-based opacity are unchanged.  There is increased volume loss in the
 right lower lobe and right middle lobe.
