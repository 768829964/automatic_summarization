                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:16 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man after motor vehicle collision with rib fracture,
 pneumothorax, and pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___, 5:19 p.m.
 
 As denoted by greater vascular congestion, mild pulmonary edema may account
 for the increase in the extent of heterogeneous consolidation in both the
 lower lungs, or this could be due to worsening pneumonia.  Tip of the
 endotracheal tube is still above the upper margin of the clavicles, no less
 than 6 cm from the carina.  It can be safely advanced 2 cm for more secured
 seating.  Small left pneumothorax is of larger apical component today,
 probably increased somewhat overall since ___.  I do not see appreciable
 right pneumothorax.  Small right pleural effusion is presumed.  The large
 hematoma in the lateral aspect of the right hemithorax is unchanged since at
 least ___.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 Feeding tube is coiled in the stomach.  Right central venous catheter ends in
 the mid SVC.  Pleural tubes unchanged in positions crossing the right mid
 chest and in the left apex, respectively.
