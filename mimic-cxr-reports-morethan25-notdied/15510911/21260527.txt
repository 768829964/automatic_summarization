 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___F, PMH of anxiety/depression presenting after MVC versus tree
 sustaining multiple injuries, including C6-7 transverse process fracture
 associated with hematoma, right ICA dissection, bilateral PTX with extensive
 RUL pulmonary contusions/lacerations s/p bilateral pigtail placement, C7-T3
 spinous process fractures, T1-6 transverse process fractures, right 2nd rib
 head fracture, IVH with layering in dependent ___ ventricle, liver I, IV, V
 lacerations, extensive R facial laceration s/p repair by Plastics, right
 humeral shaft fracture s/p intramedullary nailing, and right midclavicle
 fracture.chest tubes changed to water seal. Recurrent pneumothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 05:32.
 
 New tracheostomy tube is midline.  There is the suggestion of mild narrowing
 of the tracheal lumen at the level of the tip.  Clinical correlation advised.
 
 Right lung clear.  Left lower lobe consolidation and volume loss unchanged. 
 Bilateral pigtail pleural drainage catheter is in place with no appreciable
 pleural effusion or evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 Heart size normal.  Leftward shift of the lower mediastinum is unchanged.
