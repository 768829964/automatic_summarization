  placement.
  2. Small right apical pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___F with MVC, bilateral pigtail placement*** WARNING *** Multiple
 patients with same last name!  // evaluate for improvement of pneumothoraces
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ CT chest/abdomen/pelvis
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Interval placement of bilateral chest tubes.  Persistent small right hand
 moderate left pneumothoraces without midline shift.  A right apical cap is
 again seen as well as marked right mediastinal widening.  Right lung and
 retrocardiac opacities correspond to pulmonary contusions seen on CT.  An
 endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.7 cm above the carina. 
 Previously described fractures are grossly unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Small right and moderate left pneumothoraces status-post chest tube
 placement.
 2. Multifocal consolidation, likely a combination of contusion and aspiration.
 
 3. Right mediastinal widening and right apical cap have been more fully
 assessed by cross-sectional imaging along with extensive fractures.
