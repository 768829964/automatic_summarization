                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with bilateral chest tubes  // Eval for PTX
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 06:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Rotated positioning.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.7 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm.  A left subclavian central
 line is present, tip over distal SVC.  2 pigtail catheters are present, 1 over
 the lower portion of both right and left chest.  Previously seen small left
 apical pneumothorax is not appreciated on the current study.  And possible and
 a small medial right apical pneumothorax, as seen previously, could be
 obscured by The patient rotation.
 
 Increased retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation.  The left costophrenic angles better defined, suggestion
 improvement in the degree of left pleural fluid.  Possible trace residual hazy
 opacity right upper zone.
 
 Note again made of the fracture of the right midclavicle.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previously seen small left apical pneumothorax no longer visualized, though
 this could be artifact due to patient rotation.  No other evidence of
 pneumothorax is detected.
 
 No CHF.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation again seen.  Suspect interval
 improvement in small left pleural effusion
 
 Minimal residual hazy opacity right upper zone.  Right lung and costophrenic
 sulcus otherwise grossly clear.
