                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with polytrauma bilateral pigtails  //
 ?interval change      ?interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the bilateral pigtail catheters are
 unchanged.  No definite pneumothorax in this patient with hyperexpansion of
 the lungs.
 The right upper lobe opacity continues to decrease.  However, the opacity at
 the left base has increased and the hemidiaphragm is now silhouetted,
 consistent with substantial volume loss in the left lower lobe.
 Although the cardiac silhouette appears to be displaced toward the left, much
 of this could merely reflect obliquity of the patient, rather than mediastinal
 shift due to left lower lobe volume loss.
 Fracture of the midportion of the right clavicle is again seen.
