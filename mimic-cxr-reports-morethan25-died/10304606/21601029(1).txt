                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ESRD, CHF, MRSA endocarditis, s/p NGT
 palcement  // assess for NGT placement      assess for NGT placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patient rotation to the right is consistent, and it makes assessment of
 mediastinal shift in that direction impossible, but there is the suggestion of
 persistent right lower lobe atelectasis.  Low lung volumes exaggerate vascular
 crowding and possible interstitial edema in the left lung but there has been
 no change in either over the past several days.  Moderate cardiomegaly is
 chronic, improved since ___.  No pneumothorax.
 
 NG tube passes into the nondistended stomach and out of view.  Right jugular
 line ends at the level of the superior cavoatrial junction.
