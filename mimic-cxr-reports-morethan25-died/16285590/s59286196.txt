                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acutely worsening hypoxia in a patient with invasive
 aspergillosis and COPD.  Evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the most recent study, the left hemidiaphragmatic
 contour is now better defined, indication that the left pleural effusion and
 atelectasis are improving.  There are linear opacities surrounding the
 mediastinum, consistent with chronic radiation changes.  There is mild
 pulmonary vascular engorgement, but no frank pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The heart size is normal and the mediastinal width is
 unchanged.  A left PICC has been removed.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval resolution of left lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusion.
 2.  Mild pulmonary vascular engorgement without frank pulmonary edema.
