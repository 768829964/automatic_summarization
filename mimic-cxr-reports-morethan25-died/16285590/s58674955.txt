                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chest tube for pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with ___ at 10:59 a.m., the left effusion may be very slightly
 larger.  There is associated left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. 
 No pneumothorax is identified.  The left chest tube is unchanged.  Patchy
 opacity at the right base and in the right middle zone is similar, possibly
 slightly improved.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity at left base, which likely represents
 combination of a slightly larger left effusion and underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  No pneumothorax detected.
