                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia, status post bronch biopsy, question pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 A left-sided chest tube is in place.  There is a small left effusion with
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  There is also patchy opacity at the
 right base.  The extreme right costophrenic angle is excluded from the film. 
 Compared with one day earlier, cardiomediastinal silhouette and other findings
 are essentially unchanged.  No pneumothorax is detected.
