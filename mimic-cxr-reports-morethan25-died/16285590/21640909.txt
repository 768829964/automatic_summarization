                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:11 A.M. ___.
 
 HISTORY:  COPD.  Chemo radiation for lung cancer.  Chylous pleural effusion. 
 Following bronchoscopy.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened slightly since ___ and there
 is considerably more consolidation at the right lung base, unchanged on the
 left.  Overall findings suggest mild pulmonary edema, but worsening of
 pneumonia in the right lower lung is an alternative to be considered as well
 as deposition of edema in the site of active infection.  Small left pleural
 effusion is stable.  Tiny left apical pneumothorax has appeared since ___, basal pleural tube is essentially unchanged in position.  Heart size is
 normal.  Paramediastinal fibrosis obscures the contour of the mediastinum in
 the aortopulmonic window.
