                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient with respiratory failure, Aspergillus
 pneumonia, COPD.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Mild pulmonary edema has minimally improved.  Left perihilar consolidation,
 mainly in the left upper lobe, has minimally increased.  Right lower lobe and
 lingular consolidations are grossly unchanged.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions, larger on the left side, have minimally increased.  Cardiac size
 cannot be evaluated.  Lines and tubes remain in unchanged positions with left
 PICC tip in the left brachiocephalic vein, ET tube tip 2.6 cm above the carina
 and NG tube tip out of view below the diaphragm.
