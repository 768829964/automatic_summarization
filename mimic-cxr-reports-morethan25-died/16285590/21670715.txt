                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with COPD, congestive heart failure here with
 dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size is mildly enlarged.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unchanged with continued elevation of the left hilus.  Prominence of the hila
 bilaterally reflects the previously demonstrated soft tissue which encases the
 hilar regions and tracts along the lower lobe airways, as seen on the recent
 CT.  Pulmonary vasculature is not engorged.  Small left pleural effusion may
 be slightly increased in size compared to the previous study.  Atelectasis is
 seen in the left lung base.  Aeration in the right base is improved with
 decreased extent of the previously noted patchy right basilar opacity.  No new
 focal consolidation is present.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Improved aeration in the right base with decreased right basilar patchy
 opacity thought to reflect airways disease on the previous CT.
 2. Small left pleural effusion, perhaps slightly increased in the interval.
 3. Unchanged abnormal appearance of the hilar contours, reflective of prior
 radiation treatment and known soft tissue encasement, as seen on the prior CT.
