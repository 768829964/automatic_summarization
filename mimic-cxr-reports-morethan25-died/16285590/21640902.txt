                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with pleural effusion after
 chest tube insertion.  Note is made that the original dictation was lost and
 the study was brought to our review today on ___.
 
 AP radiograph, chest
 
 As compared to the prior study, there is interval decrease of a left pleural
 effusion after insertion of the pigtail catheter.  The left periaortic opacity
 appears to be slightly more progressed and might potentially reflect a
 combination of atelectasis and known post-radiation changes.  Right lower lung
 opacity is gradually progressing as compared to ___ that was
 not present.
