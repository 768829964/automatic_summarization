                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent lung tap for fungal infection.  Assess for effusion or
 infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest were acquired.  A
 moderate left pleural effusion is increased compared to the prior study from
 ___.  Consolidation at the left lung base is at least partially
 related to compressive atelectasis, although a concomitant infectious process
 is certainly possible.  Reticulonodular opacities in the right mid-to-lower
 lung are new compared to the prior study, highly concerning for an infectious
 process.  The heart size is difficult to assess given the moderate left
 effusion, but appears unchanged.  The mediastinal contours are normal.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar
 spine are seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  New reticulonodular right mid-to-lower lung opacities, concerning for
 infection.
 
 2.  Increased moderate left pleural effusion with dense left retrocardiac
 atelectasis.  Concomitant infection at the left lung base cannot be excluded.
