                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with a history of recurrent chylothorax, now with
 chest drain placed.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a left-sided pleural pigtail
 catheter.  A portion of it just upstream from the pigtail appears to be kinked
 on this frontal view, although a lateral view may be helpful in determining
 the validity of that.  There has been improvement of the left-sided pleural
 effusion with only a minimal amount of residual pleural fluid left.  There is
 no pneumothorax.  There has been improvement of the left basal atelectasis. 
 Mild consolidation at the right costophrenic angle is also present. 
 Otherwise, the mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Status post left pleural pigtail catheter placement with
 improvement in pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.  Residual left and
 persistent right atelectasis.
