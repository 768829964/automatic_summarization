                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 INDICATION:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear stable including mild to
 moderate cardiomegaly. There is a persistent small to moderate pleural
 effusion on the left. What has changed is increased patchy opacity in the left
 mid and lower lungs. There is background mild interstitial abnormality
 suggesting some degree of coinciding fluid overload.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Increasing opacification of the left lower lobe concerning for pneumonia
 versus waxing and waning, now increased atelectasis. Suspected mild coinciding
 fluid overload.
