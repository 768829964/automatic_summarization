                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female with multiple medical problems with a midline.
 Please evaluate for line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Greater consolidation at both lung bases, particularly the right and the left
 suprahilar lung and a substantial increase in irregular linear and nodular
 opacities, primarily in the left lower lung should first be considered
 progression of diffuse infection, but, given the widespread preexisting lung
 abnormalities and the interval increase in top normal heart size, the
 asymmetric distribution of new pulmonary edema could give the same appearance.
 
 Left sided catheter ends in the axilla. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Likely progression of multifocal lung infection. Possible acute
 CHF. Left sided catheter ends in the axilla.
