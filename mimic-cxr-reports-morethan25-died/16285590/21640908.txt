                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Question worsening pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, 1 VW
 
 No left-sided chest tube is in place.  No definite pneumothorax is identified.
 Slight streaky lucency along the left cardiac border and at the left apex
 could reflect very subtle evidence of pneumothorax.  There is patchy opacity
 at left greater than right bases, consistent with collapse and/or
 consolidation.  There is a small left effusion and minimal blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle.  There are some additional focal densities in the
 right base laterally. 
 
 Compared with ___ at 7:55 a.m., the cardiomediastinal silhouette and
 bibasilar opacities with left effusion are unchanged.
