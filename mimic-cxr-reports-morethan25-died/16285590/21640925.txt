                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___-year-old female with cough.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are compared to multiple
 previous exams dating back to ___.  Compared to most recent exam,
 there has been interval enlargement of the left-sided pleural effusion which
 is moderate.  It may be partially loculated laterally.  The appearance of the
 right basilar consolidation has progressed as well.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval enlargement of left-sided pleural effusion which may be
 partially loculated laterally.  Underlying left base atelelectasis, infection
