                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:   ___ year-old woman with a history HFrEF (NYHA III/IV, EF ___%),
 CAD s/p LAD stent (not done at ___, no cath images) with recurrence of
 poorly differentiated stage IIIb NSCLC diagnosed in ___ s/p chemo/RT
 previously in remission, but now with recurrence, severe oxygen-dependent COPD
 (FEV1 ___%, ___L O2), and multiple admissions for dyspnea now with ?PNA  //
 Interval change, pulm edema?
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 CT chest with contrast dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ETT terminates 1.5 cm above the carina with neck flexion.  NG tube with
 side hole in the region of the GE junction.  Left PICC in the mid subclavian. 
 Left IJ in the mid SVC.
 
 Bilateral perihilar opacities and bibasilar atelectasis are unchanged in
 comparison to the prior chest radiograph dated ___.  The lungs are
 otherwise clear.  Heart size is stable.  The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable. The pulmonary vasculature is normal.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ETT in appropriate positioning with neck flexion, but should not be
 advanced further.
 2. NG tube with side hole in the region of the GE junction, which should be
 advanced 5 cm.
 3. Unchanged bilateral perihilar opacities, which represent peripheral
 bronchial impaction, are better evaluated on the CT dated ___
 4. Bibasilar atelectasis.
