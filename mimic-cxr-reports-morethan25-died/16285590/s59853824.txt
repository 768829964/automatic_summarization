                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Bronchoscopy with falling O2 and hemoptysis.
 
 FINDINGS:  No evidence of post-procedure pneumothorax.  Left chest tube
 remains in place and the previously described perihilar and suprahilar mass is
 again seen.  Increased opacification at the right base is worrisome for
 aspiration or supervening pneumonia.  Less prominent opacification is seen at
 the left base.
