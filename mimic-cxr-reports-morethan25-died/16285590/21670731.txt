                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o woman with h/o HFrEF, CAD s/p LAD stent, and recurrence of
 poorly differentiated stage IIIb NSCLC dx in ___ in remission s/p chemo/RT,
 and severe oxygen-dependent COPD, admitted on ___ for dyspnea and transferred
 on ___ (HOD9) to MICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Most likely
 hypovolemiv given aggressive diuresis prior to ICU transfer vs. infectious,
 now on levo and Van/Zosyn.  // interval assessment
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST X-RAY FROM ___ AT 03:59
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lines and tubes are similar prior.  Again seen is a thin line overlying the
 left axilla and projecting immediately inside the left chest wall --___ this a
 PICC line?  If so, it does not reach the SVC.  No pneumothorax detected.
 
 Again seen is a small left effusion, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation, overall similar to the prior study.  Also again seen is patchy
 opacity, possibly atelectasis, in the right cardiophrenic region ,and minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle.  No definite CHF.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette unchanged .  Fibrotic changes in left suprahilar region are again
 noted.
 
 Previously identified left lower chest rib fracture not well seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall similar to 1 day prior.
 
 Clinical correlation regarding possible left-sided PICC line requested.
