                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Recurrent pleural effusion, the patient with chest tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Bibasilar consolidations have worsened
 bilaterally; on the left could be just reexpansion pulmonary edema, on the
 right is likely pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax.  Small left pleural
 effusion is unchanged.
