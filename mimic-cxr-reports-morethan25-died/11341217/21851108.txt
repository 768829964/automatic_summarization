                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the transparency of the
 lung parenchyma has minimally increased, likely reflecting improved
 ventilation.  The monitoring and support devices are constant.  However, the
 overall extent of the pre-existing parenchymal opacities is still severe. 
 Small pleural effusions bilaterally, right more than left, constant in
 appearance.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  No pneumothorax.
