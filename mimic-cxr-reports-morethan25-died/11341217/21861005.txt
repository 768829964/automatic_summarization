                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure and ARDS // eval for
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest x-ray.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior radiographs of the chest dated ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-upright radiograph of the chest demonstrates low lung volumes
 which results in bronchovascular crowding. Heterogeneous opacification of the
 lungs is consistent with edema without pulmonary vascular engorgement, and
 multifocal pneumonia. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 There is no pneumothorax.  The right-sided internal jugular central venous
 line ends in the mid SVC. The left-sided internal jugular central venous line
 ends  in the distal SVC.  The endotracheal tube ends 4.7 cm from thecarina. 
 The nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and out of the field of view.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heterogeneous opacification of the lungs is consistent with edema without
 pulmonary vascular engorgement, and multifocal pneumonia
