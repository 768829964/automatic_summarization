                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of endocarditis and prevertebral abscess with a right
 loculated pleural effusion status post two chest tube placements.  Please
 evaluate for endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___ and CT of the
 chest from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiac silhouette is top normal, overall stable compared to
 the prior exams.  Again seen are two right pleural catheters seen ending in
 the medial right thoracic region, overall minimally changed in position
 compared to the CT from ___.  Again seen is the left lingular and
 lower lobe consolidation, overall slightly worse compared to the chest
 radiograph from ___; however, better evaluated on the prior CT. 
 There is an overall slightly worse appearance of the aeration of the
 parenchyma with multiple relatively diffuse multifocal parenchymal opacities
 and ongoing lung volumes that are low.  Bilateral small pleural effusions are
 overall stable in size.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The ET tube
 terminates approximately 5 cm from the carina.  There is a right IJ which
 terminates in the low SVC.  There is an enteric tube, which extends below the
 diaphragm and terminates within the body of the stomach.  The visualized
 osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Overall stable position of the two drains. ET tube is in appropriate
 position.
 
 2.  Slight interval worsening of the multifocal opacities compared to the exam
 from ___; however, better evaluated on the CT from ___.
