                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Left internal jugular venous catheter.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Earlier in the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left internal central jugular venous catheter terminates in the
 lower superior vena cava.  There is no pneumothorax.  The patient remains
 intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates about 3 cm above the carina.  An
 orogastric tube courses into the stomach, its termination point not imaged,
 however.  Lung volumes are low and there is persistent retrocardiac
 opacification that is not specific, although typical for atelectasis. 
 Etiologies such as pneumonia or aspiration are also possible in addition to
 probable coinciding pleural effusion.  The pulmonary vascularity appears
 prominent along each hilum and indistinct suggesting vascular congestion that
 has somewhat worsened.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Status post left internal jugular venous line placement, terminating in
 the superior vena cava; no pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Persistent opacification of the left lung base, probably including a
 pleural effusion.
 
 3.  Findings suggesting vascular congestion, which has increased.
