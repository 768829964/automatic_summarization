                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Endocarditis.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there are slightly improved
 lung volumes.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications again are consistent
 with pulmonary edema and small right effusion.  In the appropriate clinical
 setting, supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
 
 Endotracheal tube tip lies approximately 4 cm above the carina.  The right
 subclavian catheter extends to about the level of the cavoatrial junction and
 the nasogastric tube extends well into the stomach.
