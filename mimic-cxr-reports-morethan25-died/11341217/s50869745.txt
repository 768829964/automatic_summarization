                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of septic emboli to the lungs bilaterally.  Status post
 removal of chest tubes.  Please evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs dated back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube terminates 4.6 cm above the carina.  There is
 an enteric tube with the tip which terminates below the diaphragm.  Right IJ
 catheter terminates in the SVC.  The lung volumes are low.  There is mild
 stable cardiomegaly.  There has been interval improvement of the opacification
 overlying the right lower lung.  Pulmonary vascular congestion persists. 
 There is stable mild bilateral pulmonary edema. There does appear to be slight
 interval worsening of opacity overlying the mid left lung.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Although there does appear to be slight interval worsening in the
 opacification overlying the mid left lung, there does appear to be overall
 interval improvement in aeration in the remainder of the lungs bilaterally.
