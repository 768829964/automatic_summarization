                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of endocarditis and septic emboli to the lungs with
 parapneumonic effusion.  Please evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple chest radiographs dated back to ___ and chest
 CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The ET tube terminates approximately 38 mm above the carina in
 appropriate position.  There is a right-sided IJ which terminates at the low
 SVC.  There is an enteric tube, which extends below the diaphragm and the tip
 out of view from this film.  Slightly lower lung volumes and interval increase
 in mild interstitial edema likely account for the increase in generalized
 opacification throughout the lungs bilaterally.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable
 compared to prior exams dated back to at least ___.  There are small
 stable bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Slight interval worsening of mild bilateral pulmonary edema in the setting of
 extensive multifocal pneumonia.
