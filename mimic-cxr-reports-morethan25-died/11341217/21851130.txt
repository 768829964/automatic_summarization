                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Endocarditis, septic emboli and abscesses.  Evaluation for
 interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change, except for the fact that the internal jugular vein catheter has been
 removed.  The bilateral relatively massive parenchymal opacities are constant
 in appearance.  The potential lateral right pleural air inclusion is also
 unchanged.  Mild cardiomegaly.  No larger pleural effusions.
