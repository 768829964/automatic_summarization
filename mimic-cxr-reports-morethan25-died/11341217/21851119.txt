                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Septic emboli, pneumonia, chest tubes placed, check for
 pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST AP SEMI-UPRIGHT
 
 Comparison is made with the prior chest x-ray of 5 hours previous.  No
 pneumothorax is identified.  The overall appearances are essentially the same.
 The endotracheal tube is somewhat low, 2.4 cm from the carinal angle.  This
 could be withdrawn to a better position.
 
 Diffuse patchy opacities are again noted throughout both lungs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube placement slightly low.  No pneumothorax either
 side.  Extensive opacities.
