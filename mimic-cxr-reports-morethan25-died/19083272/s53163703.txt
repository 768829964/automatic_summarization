 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:14 PM
  Stable diffuse pulmonary opacities.  Near complete resolution of moderate
  right pleural effusion.  PICC tip in low SVC.  New R pleural catheter pigtail
  is not formed.  The bend at the beginning of the pigtail is outside the chest,
  suggesting that this ___ has been at least partially pulled out.  no
  pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with pleural effusion after pigtail drainage. 
 Assess for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Multiple previous examinations, most recently ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right-sided pleural effusion is decreased after placement of right
 pleural catheter, which may have been withdrawn slightly as pigtail is
 partially external to the chest and not formed.  Pulmonary opacities are
 slightly increased, particularly in the bilateral apices, compatible with
 superimposed pulmonary edema with unchanged dense left basal opacity at least
 in part reflecting atelectasis.  Right PICC is in stable position.  No
 appreciable pneumothorax is seen.  The left costophrenic angle is excluded
 from view.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased parenchymal opacities compatible with superimposed
 pulmonary edema. Improved right-sided pleural effusion with pigtail catheter
 not clearly formed and partially withdrawn from the chest.
 
 These findings regarding the pigtail catheter were discussed with Dr. ___
 by Dr. ___ by phone at ___ on ___.
