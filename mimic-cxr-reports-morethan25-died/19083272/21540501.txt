                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Acute hypoxemia in a patient with volume overload,
 healthcare-associated pneumonia, and critical aortic stenosis.
 
 COMPARISONS:  A series of chest radiographs from ___ dating back to
 ___; CT of the torso from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Semi-upright bedside AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates
 diffuse bilateral heterogeneous opacities representing moderate-to-severe
 pulmonary edema, which has worsened from two days ago.  Asymmetric prominence
 of the right upper lung opacity is also noted when compared to the two prior
 studies from ___ and ___.  There continues to be moderate cardiomegaly
 and pulmonary and mediastinal vascular engorgement.  There are probable
 persistent bilateral pleural effusions, better appreciated on the CT from ___.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening biventricular congestive heart failure.
 2.  Asymmetric right upper lobe pulmonary edema or worsening edema and right
 upper lobe pneumonia in the appropriate clinical context.
