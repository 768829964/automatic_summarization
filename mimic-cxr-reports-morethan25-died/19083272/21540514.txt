                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Intubated ___-year-old gentleman with respiratory failure, assess
 for interval change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 2.4 cm above the carina.  Nasogastric tube
 courses into the stomach and out of view.  Right-sided PICC terminates in the
 mid SVC and left IJ is in the upper SVC.  Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema
 is mildly improved with the interval development of bilateral left greater
 than right small-to-moderate pleural effusions which may reflect
 redistribution.  Cardiac size is slightly improved from the previous
 examination.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Slight improvement in moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema with development of
 likely redistributed left greater than right small-to-moderate effusions.
