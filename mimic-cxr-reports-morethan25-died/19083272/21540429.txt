                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male status post abdominal surgery with critical AS.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Upright portable chest radiograph demonstrates increasing bibasilar
 opacities, with likely small bilateral pleural effusions, and an interval
 increase in pulmonary edema, now moderate in degree.  Airspace opacity in the
 right upper lobe may reflect asymmetric edema or developing infection. The
 cardiac silhouette remains enlarged, and is slightly increased in size
 compared with prior.  The mediastinal contours are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in heart size, and in pulmonary edema which is
 now moderate.  There are small bilateral pleural effusions.  Airspace opacity
 in the right upper lobe is new and may represent asymmetric edema or
 developing infection.
