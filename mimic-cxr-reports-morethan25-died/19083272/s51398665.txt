 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath, severe aortic stenosis, volume overload.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. 
 The monitoring and support devices are in constant position.  There is
 constant evidence of fluid overload and a likely small left pleural effusion
 with subsequent retrocardiac atelectasis.  The changes are not substantially
 changed since the previous examination.  The right pleural drain is in
 constant position.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
