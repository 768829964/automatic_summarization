 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Reintubation, evaluation for endotracheal tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 10:14 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient was
 reintubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carina.
 The newly placed nasogastric tube has its tip in the proximal parts of the
 stomach.  The other monitoring and support devices are constant.
 
 There is minimal improvement in transparency of the lung parenchyma at the
 lung bases, likely reflecting the effect of ventilatory pressure.  Otherwise,
 the radiograph is unchanged.  There is no evidence of complications.
