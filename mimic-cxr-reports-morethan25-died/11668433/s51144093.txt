                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 REPORT:
 
 The patient's ET tube, NG tube, and right-sided PICC line appear in unchanged
 positions.  Again, the PICC line probably lies at the cavoatrial junction or
 the right atrium.  The ET tube is reasonably well centered.
 
 There is a right-sided pleural effusion, unchanged from before.  The left
 chest appears grossly normal.  There is some obscuration of the retrocardiac
 soft tissues, suggesting minimal residual left basilar atelectasis, improved. 
 Lung parenchyma is otherwise grossly clear.
