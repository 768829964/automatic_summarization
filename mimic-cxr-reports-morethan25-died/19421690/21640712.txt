 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has developed new
 bilateral interstitial opacities, the opacities are diffusely distributed in
 the lungs but are best seen at the level of the right upper lobe.  The
 findings are highly suggestive for pneumonia, a viral origin or PCP should be
 strongly considered.  No pleural effusions.  Mild widening of the mediastinum,
 potentially suggestive of reactive adenopathy.  No cardiomegaly.  The left
 central access line has been removed.
