                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate positioning of nasogastric tube in a patient with
 pancreatitis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent radiograph from ___ at 3:07 p.m. and a
 series of older studies dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach, with the side
 port beyond the gastroesophageal junction.  An enteric feeding tube loops once
 in the stomach, courses inferiorly into the duodenum and out of the field of
 view and the tip can be seen in the proximal jejunum.  A tracheostomy tube is
 appropriately positioned.  A left subclavian triple-lumen central venous
 catheter terminates in the mid SVC.
 
 There are persistent small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar
 atelectasis.  There is improved aeration in the upper lung fields resulting
 from resolution of mild pulmonary edema.  The mediastinal width has also
 decreased, suggestive of resolution of mild hypervolemia.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  The nasogastric tube terminates within the stomach with the side port
 beyond the gastroesophageal junction.
 2.  The enteric feeding tube loops once within the stomach and terminates in
 the proximal jejunum.
 3.  Resolution of hypervolemia and pulmonary edema.
 4.  Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
