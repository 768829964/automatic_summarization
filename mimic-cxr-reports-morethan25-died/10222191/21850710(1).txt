                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, intubated, evaluate for
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient is intubated, the tip of the endotracheal tube lies
 approximately 4.7 cm from the level of the carina, its tip is directed against
 the tracheal wall.  An NG tube is in place, the tip of which is not
 visualized, though it does pass below the level of the diaphragm.  A right IJ
 central venous catheter is unchanged in appearance with its tip projecting at
 the level of the cavoatrial junction.  There are similarly low lung volumes
 from ___, bibasilar opacity is not significantly changed.  Increasing left
 lower lobe opacity from priors may reflect developing infection. Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are not changed.  There is no pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Increasing left lower lobe opacity, recommend attention on follow up to
 exclude developing pneumonia.
 
 2.  ETT tube tip directed at the tracheal wall. This could be repositioned if
 there is difficulty ventilating the patient.
 
 Findings were discussed with ___ nurse ___ at 12:20pm by phone; the patient
 had since been extubated.
