                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Thoracentesis, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of earlier in this date, there has been
 thoracentesis on the right with removal of a substantial amount of fluid.  The
 underlying lung is almost completely reexpanded and there is no evidence of
 pneumothorax.  Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with vascular congestion
 and probable small left effusion with atelectasis are unchanged.
