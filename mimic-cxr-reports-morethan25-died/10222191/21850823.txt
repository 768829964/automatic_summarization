                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pancreatitis, after multiple abdominal washouts.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  Substantial decrease in the right basilar
 opacification.  Continued retrocardiac opacification with obscuration of the
 hemidiaphragm and costophrenic angle, consistent with volume loss in the left
 lower lobe and pleural effusion.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 supervening pneumonia would have to be considered.
