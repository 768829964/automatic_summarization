                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pancreatitis, intubated, assess NG tube
 placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable semi-upright chest radiograph was obtained.  Right
 internal jugular catheter terminates in the upper SVC.  Endotracheal tube is
 in the lower trachea, 2.3 cm above the carina, and should not be advanced any
 further.  Nasogastric tube terminates just beyond the GE junction with
 sidehole in the distal esophagus and can be advanced 10 cm for better
 positioning.  Otherwise, left greater than right bibasilar atelectasis is
 unchanged with normal cardiomediastinal contours.  Small effusions are likely
 also present.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Nasogastric tube terminates in the proximal stomach and should be advanced
 10 cm for more optimal positioning,
 2.  Left greater than right bibasilar atelectasis and effusions as before.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 09:45 on ___,
 two minutes after discovery.
