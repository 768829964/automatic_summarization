                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with new nasogastric tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a faint linear structure projecting over the heart.  This
 likely represents the nasogastric tube.  The side port and tip are not beyond
 the GE junction and this could be advanced several centimeters for optimal
 placement.   We recommend repeat images for further evaluation as
 visualization of the catheter is quite difficult.   The visualized lower lung
 fields are grossly clear.
