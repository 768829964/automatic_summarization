                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female post coronary artery bypass grafting,
 postoperative left MCA stroke.  Evaluate Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CHEST, AP:  Nasogastric tube has been removed, and a new Dobbhoff tube coils
 in the stomach.  The endotracheal tube has been retracted, and now lies 2.2 cm
 above the carina.  Right internal jugular vascular sheath again terminates in
 the upper SVC.  There is no significant pneumothorax.  Increased right and
 persistent left lower lobe opacities.  Changes of median sternotomy,
 mediastinal clips, and coronary artery bypass grafting are noted.  Prominent
 cardiomediastinal contour is unchanged.  There is continued central venous
 congestion, mild pulmonary edema, and small bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Dobbhoff tube and endotracheal tubes in standard position.
 2.  Mild pulmonary edema.
 3.  Increased right and persistent left lower lobe opacities, which may
 represent atelectasis or pneumonia.
