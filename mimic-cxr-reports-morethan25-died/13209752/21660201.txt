  There is no pneumothorax after thoracentesis.  The large left pleural effusion
  has resolved new linear opacities in the left lower lobe are consistent with
  residual re-expansion atelectasis.

 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Status post CABG and status post thoracentesis, assess for
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There has been interval markedly decrease in size in left pleural effusion,
 currently is very small.  There is no pneumothorax.  There is mild vascular
 congestion.  There are multifocal plate-like atelectasis in the left perihilar
