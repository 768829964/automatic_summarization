 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p MVR, CABG // follow up edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube is in unchanged position.  Left PICC terminates in lower SVC.  Right

 courses below the diaphragm and out of view.  Sternotomy wires are intact. 
 Pulmonary edema is resolved in the right lung.  Left lung pulmonary edema is
 persistent.  Left lung base opacities increased, likely reflecting increased
 atelectasis and pleural effusion.  Small right pleural effusion is stable. 
 Mildly enlarged cardiac silhouette is stable.
