 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 7:58 AM
  
  
  Moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is moderate edema, worsened. 
  Probable moderate right and small left pleural effusions.  An endotracheal
  tube appears to terminate in the mid thoracic trachea.  There are 2 enteric
  tubes, 1 appears to course below the level of the diaphragm.  The other is not
  well assessed.  The shoulders are not well evaluated due to patient rotation,
  however there is question of shoulder dislocation, particularly on the left. 
  Clinical correlation is recommended.
