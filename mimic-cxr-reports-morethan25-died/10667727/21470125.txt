 WET READ: ___ ___ 10:38 AM
  A large right-sided pleural effusion is minimally increased from the prior
  examination and partially re distributed. There is some atelectasis of the
  basal left lung however the left lung appears similar to the prior study. A
  left-sided internal jugular catheter is seen with its tip in the mid SVC.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST PORT. LINE PLACEMENT; CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF  // dialysis cath placement in LIJ  
 Contact name: ___ ___, ___: ___
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest from ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier the same day at 08:06.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The ___ radiograph shows interval placement of a left IJ dialysis
 catheter which ends in the mid SVC.  There is no pneumothorax. A dual lead
 left-sided pacemaker remains in place.  A large right pleural effusion is
 unchanged. The trachea and mediastinal structures are midline, suggesting
 there is some component of atelectasis. The left lung is clear.
 
 The followup radiograph from ___ shows slight increase in the
 large right pleural effusion. In addition, the left IJ dialysis catheter has
 been slightly withdrawn, and now ends at the junction of the upper SVC and
 brachiocephalic vein.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post placement of a left IJ dialysis catheter, which initially ends in
 the mid SVC, but the followup radiograph shows retraction to the junction of
 the upper SVC and brachiocephalic vein.
 
 Slight interval increase in large right pleural effusion with some component
 of right lung atelectasis. Progressive decreased aeration of the right lung.
