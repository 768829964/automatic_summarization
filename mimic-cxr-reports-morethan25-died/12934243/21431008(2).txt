                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate OG tube placement.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___, at 11:54.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single semi-upright AP view of the chest is obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  The new enteric tube courses below the diaphragm with the tip in
 the stomach.  The stomach remains distended with air.  An endotracheal tube is
 in satisfactory position, 4 cm from the carina.  A right PICC is unchanged
 with the tip in the mid SVC.
 
 There are bilateral pleural effusions, slightly larger on the left than the
 right, which are not significantly changed from the prior exam.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Emphysematous changes and atelectasis, particularly on the
 right, are unchanged.  There is some volume loss at the lower lobes
 bilaterally, slightly more prominent in the left lower lobe.  Since the prior
 exam, pulmonary edema has improved.  The patient is rotated, but within the
 limitations, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Satisfactory position of the orogastric tube.
 2.  Interval improvement in the pulmonary edema.
 3.  Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
