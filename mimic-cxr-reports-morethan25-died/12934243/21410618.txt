                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 Comparison is made with a prior chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Altered mental status, assess pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph is obtained.  The heart is
 markedly enlarged.  There are bilateral pleural effusions, appearing similar
 to the prior on the left, though diminished on the right with right effusion
 appearing loculated.  The possibility of a left lower lobe pneumonia is
 impossible to exclude given the opacification and presumed left lower lobe
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.  Upper lungs appear well aerated.  Bony
 structures appear stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusions, stable left and
 diminished right (loculated).  Cannot exclude left lower lobe pneumonia.
