                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent aspiration pneumonia, now extubated.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  The monitoring and support devices remain in place.  Bilateral
 pleural effusions persist, more prominent on the left with some degree of
 loculation and thickening.  Opacification at the left base most likely
 reflects volume loss in the lower lobe, though the possibility of superimposed
 infection would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
