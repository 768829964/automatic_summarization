                                 FINAL REPORT
 STUDY:  AP chest, ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with aspiration pneumonia and volume
 overload.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 FINDINGS:  Comparison is made to previous study from ___.
 
 There has been removal of the endotracheal tube and feeding tube since the
 previous study.  There is a right-sided central line with the distal lead tip
 in the mid SVC.  Study is somewhat limited due to obliquity in positioning of
 the patient.  There is cardiomegaly.  There are again seen diffuse airspace
 opacities with loculated pleural fluid along the right lateral chest wall.  A
 left-sided pleural effusion is seen.  There is also likely an element of
 pulmonary edema.  No pneumothoraces are identified.
