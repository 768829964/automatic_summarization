                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Back and abdominal pain, dementia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph, ___.
 
 UPRIGHT AP AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  Study is limited due to patient
 rotation and exclusion of the extreme costophrenic angles.  Allowing for this,
 the cardiac silhouette size remains mildly enlarged.  The aorta appears
 ectatic.  No pulmonary vascular congestion is noted.  There may be patchy
 bibasilar opacities suggestive of atelectasis, though infection cannot be
 excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Multilevel degenerative changes of the
 thoracic spine are present, though evaluation for a fracture is limited.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited exam.  Probable bibasilar atelectasis, though infection
 cannot be excluded.  Evaluation for a thoracic spine fracture is limited on
 this study.
