                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aspiration pneumonia, for interval change.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies with the most recent chest radiograph from
 ___. 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube appears in place with the tip in the lower trachea. Right
 PICC line is unchanged with the tip in the mid SVC.  Enteric tube tip
 traverses to the stomach.  
 
 The lungs appear hyperinflated consistent with patient's underlying emphysema.
 Volume loss is again noted, particularly on the right with rightward shift of
 the mediastinum.  Since the prior study, there has been increased vascular
 congestion suggestive of heart failure.  Additionally, there is increased
 right basilar atelectasis.  Bilateral small pleural effusions appear stable. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouette appears stable. Levoscoliosis of the mid
 thoracic spine is again noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval increased right basilar atelectasis. 
 
 2.  Interval increased vascular congestion suggestive of heart failure. 
 
 3.  Bilateral small pleural effusions appear stable. 
 
 4.  Satisfactory position of supporting structures.
