                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Aspiration pneumonia with continued hypoxia. 
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Previously noted right mid lower lung opacities have improved in comparison to
 the prior study.  There is however new increased opacification of the left
 lower lung suggesting a combination of pleural effusion as well as likely
 parenchymal opacity.  Cardiac silhouette appears unchanged otherwise.  A right
 PICC is noted with its tip in the upper SVC 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval improvement in right mid and lower lung opacities with interval
 worsening of left lower lung opacities suggesting a combination of pleural
 effusion as well as parenchymal left lower lobe opacity.
