                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recurrent aspiration pneumonia, NG tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, the tip lies in satisfactory position approximately 4.2
 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present -- the tip extends beneath the
 diaphragm, extending off the film.  It appears to make a hair loop type turn
 off the film, with the tip overlying the expected location of the gastric
 fundus/body.  
 
 Rotated positioning.  The markedly abnormal appearance of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette and lungs with bibasilar effusions is overall
 similar to the prior study.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 There is diffuse osteopenia with incidental note made of what appears to be an
 old healed right proximal humeral fracture.
 
 IMPRESSION:  NG tube tip extending beneath the diaphragm.
