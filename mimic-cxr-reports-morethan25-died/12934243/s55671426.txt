                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with recurrent aspiration pneumonia, now
 intubated, s/p thoracentesis ___  // evaluate for pulmonary edema with
 fluid/blood resuscitation. evaluate for pneumothorax s/p thoracentesis
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate volume of left pleural fluid has recurred. No pneumothorax.  Large
 right fissure oral pleural fluid collection is long-standing. Moderate
 cardiomegaly unchanged. Pulmonary vasculature is more engorged, but I hesitate
 to say there is new edema. Greater opacification in the right lower lobe is
 new consolidation, raising concern for continued aspiration.
 
 Tip of the ET tube is in standard placement. Feeding tube passes below the
 diaphragm and out of view.
