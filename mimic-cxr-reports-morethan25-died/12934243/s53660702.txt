                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 5:39
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with question aspiration pneumonia, assess
 for infiltrates.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous studies dated ___ at 7:16.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film ___ 5:39 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 The endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube and right subclavian PICC line are
 likely unchanged in position given differences in patient rotation.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are likely stable.  There are layering
 bilateral effusions, left greater than right.  More focal opacity in the right
 mid-to-lower lung may represent loculated fluid, pneumonia or atelectasis. 
 Improved aeration of the right lung apex.  Lungs are hyperinflated consistent
 with underlying emphysema.  No pneumothorax.
