                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with weakness and abdominal pain.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___ and ___.  Comparison is also made to CT
 thoracic spine from ___.  When compared to prior, there has been no
 significant interval change.  The lungs are hyperinflated.  Right upper lung
 scarring is seen.  There is, however, no acute consolidation or large
 effusion.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.  Prominence of the right
 paratracheal stripe is compatible with tortuosity of the vessels seen on CT. 
 Bones are osteopenic and there are compression deformities in lower thoracic
 spine with an accentuated kyphosis.  No free air is seen below the diaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No acute cardiopulmonary process.
