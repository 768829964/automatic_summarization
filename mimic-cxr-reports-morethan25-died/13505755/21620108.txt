                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with GNR septicemia  // R/o focal infiltrates
 
 
 
 
 
 COMPARISON:
 Chest radiograph ___, read in conjunction with chest CT scan the same
 day.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly stable.  Upper mediastinal widening, particularly in the
 right tracheal paratracheal station is unchanged since ___, but new
 since earlier on ___ prior to central line placement.  This could be
 hematoma as well as mediastinal venous distention.  Small right pleural
 effusion lends increase radiodensity to the right hemithorax, probably
 unchanged.  Several small regions of opacification in the right upper lobe
 could be extension of the small right upper lobe pneumonia seen on the
 preceding chest CT scan or in combination with dependent edema if patient lies
 in the right decubitus position.
 
 Right jugular line ends in the upper right atrium, ET tube in standard
 placement, nasogastric tube, in the stomach, as before.
