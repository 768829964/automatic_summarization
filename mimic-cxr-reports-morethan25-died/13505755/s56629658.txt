                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Two portable semi erect chest radiographs demonstrate an endotracheal tube
 which on the second image is 3 cm above the level of the carina. An enteric
 tube traverses the thorax in an uncomplicated course in the anticipated
 location of the esophagus. Heart appears enlarged. Pulmonary vascular
 congestion is noted without evidence of overt pulmonary edema. Blunting of
 bilateral costophrenic angles may reflect small effusions bilaterally. There
 is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube which on repeat images appears in appropriate position.
 Heart appears enlarged with mild vascular congestion.
