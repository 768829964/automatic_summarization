                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old male HTN/DM, who presents with 6 weeks of fever,
 shortness of breath, and productive cough, found to be in atrial flutter with
 a RA thrombus on CT and with undifferentiated shock, complicated by shock
 liver and ___/?ATN, who is being treated with heparin gtt and diuresis now
 with acute decompensation with RV failure and increased O2 demand.  //
 evaluate for new acute cardiopulmonary process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 14:50
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been intubated. The
 tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4 cm above the carinal.  The patient has
 also received the nasogastric tube, the tip of the tube is not clearly
 identified on the image but the course of the tube is unremarkable.  Unchanged
 position of the previously inserted right internal jugular vein catheter.
 
 In the interval, there is an increase in radiodensity of the lung parenchyma,
 caused by an increase in diameter of the pulmonary vasculature.  In addition,
 there is new blunting of the costophrenic sinuses, likely caused by a small
 pleural effusions. Finally, the retrocardiac lung regions have become
 atelectatic and the cardiac silhouette has minimally increased in size.
 Overall, the findings are highly suggestive of moderate pulmonary edema.
