                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, please evaluate for line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to portable chest radiograph performed
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable chest radiograph demonstrates a right-sided PICC line
 within the right atrium.  The endotracheal tube is stable in position with tip
 terminating 4 cm above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing into
 stomach and out of view, though the side hole is apparent at the GE junction. 
 There is stable cardiomegaly and prominence of the hila.  The mediastinal
 contours are unremarkable.  There is minimally improved aeration compared to
 prior radiograph with persistent pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis. 
 Plate-like atelectasis again noted along the minor fissure.  No pneumothorax
 evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right-sided PICC line with tip in right atrium.  It should be withdrawn 3
 cm to terminate at the cavoatrial junction.
 2.  Nasogastric tube with side port at the level of GE junction, should be
 advanced 3-4 cm.
 3.  Slightly improved pulmonary edema.
