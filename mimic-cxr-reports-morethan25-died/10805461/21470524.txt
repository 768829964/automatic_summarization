                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  AP UPRIGHT PORTABLE VIEW OF THE CHEST.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypotension, cough.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest was obtained.  There has been
 interval placement of a right-sided large-bore central venous catheter which
 terminates in the right atrium.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  There is stable prominence of the perihilar vasculature which may be
 due to vascular congestion as well as bibasilar opacities which could relate
 to atelectasis and scarring, underlying infection or aspiration is not
 excluded.  Old right-sided rib fractures are again seen.
