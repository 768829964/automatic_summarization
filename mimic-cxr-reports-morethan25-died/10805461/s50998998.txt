                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  MSSA bacteremia, intubated patient.
 
 Comparisons made with prior study ___.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Cardiomegaly is stable.  There is improved
 aeration in the lower lobes bilaterally.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 have decreased.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged position including a right
 central catheter with tip in the upper right atrium.  There are no new lung
 abnormalities or evident pneumothorax.  There is mild vascular congestion. 
 Rounded opacities in the right upper lobe could be due to vessels on end
 and/or lung nodules.  Attention in followup studies is recommended, and if
 they are truly lung nodules they will be suspicious for septic emboli.
