                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  HIV, pulmonary hypertension, lymphocytic interstitial
 pneumonitis, moderate TR, ESRD on HD, hypertension, one week of cough with
 blood.  Expiratory wheezes.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest.  There is an increase in
 interstitial markings bilaterally with increased amount of fluid seen in the
 right minor fissure.  Bibasilar opacities are similar in appearance compared
 to prior suggesting scarring or atelectasis.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  No new focal consolidation.  Heart size is top normal. 
 Mediastinal contours are otherwise unremarkable.  Old right rib fractures and
 anterior cervical/thoracic hardware is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased interstitial markings likely represent mild interstitial edema
 or atypical infection.
 2.  Bibasilar scarring or atelectasis is similar to prior study.
