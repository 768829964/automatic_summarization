                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP UPRIGHT CHEST FILM, ___ AT 5:11
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Postmenopausal woman with DVT and hemoptysis, assess for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the prior study of ___.
 
 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 5:11 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval placement of a right internal jugular dialysis catheter, which
 has its tip in the right atrium and is in similar position to that on prior
 study dated ___.  
 
 2. The previously seen left effusion has decreased in size.  There is a
 diffuse bilateral interstitial process, which likely reflects a component of
 mild pulmonary edema.  The heart remains borderline enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  No focal airspace consolidation to
 suggest pneumonia.
