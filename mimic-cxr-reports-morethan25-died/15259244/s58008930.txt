                                 FINAL REPORT
 SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST, ___ AT 21:05 HOURS.
 
 HISTORY:  Fever and altered mental status.  The patient is on dialysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Consistent with the given history, large-bore dual-lumen dialysis
 catheter from a right internal jugular approach is in stable and standard
 course and position from a right internal jugular approach.  A left internal
 jugular central venous catheter device has been removed in the interval.  No
 consolidation or edema is evident.  The mediastinum is unremarkable.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  This is an interval change compared to the
 most recent prior study but has been noted on other prior studies.  Subtle
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a tiny effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is evident.  There are no displaced fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Interval marked enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette relative to the most recent prior exam.  However,
 other more remote exams have demonstrated enlargement of the silhouette,
 thereby suggesting the possibility of waxing and waning pericardial effusion. 
 Correlate clinically.
