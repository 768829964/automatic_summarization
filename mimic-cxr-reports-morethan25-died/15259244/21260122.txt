 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with altered mental status and left lateral chest
 wall pain.  Question pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 AP and lateral views of the chest.  Moderate left and small right pleural
 effusions  are again noted.  Left basilar opacity could be due to pleural
 fluid noting that underlying consolidation cannot be completely excluded. 
 Elsewhere the lungs are clear of consolidation.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is stable.  Prosthetic valve and median sternotomy wires are noted.  Osseous
 and soft tissue structures are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Bilateral effusions, larger on the left.  Underlying consolidation at the left
 lung base would be difficult to exclude.
