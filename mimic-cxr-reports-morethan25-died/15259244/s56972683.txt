 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ AT 20:04
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old status post mitral valve annuloplasty, CABG.
 Evaluate for position of endotracheal tube.
 
 PRIOR STUDY:  ___ at 13:29.
 
 Portable supine chest film ___ at 20:04 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian PICC line with its tip in the mid-to-distal SVC. 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip 4.5 cm above the carina.  A right internal
 jugular large-bore catheter has its tip in the right atrium, unchanged. 
 Gastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not identified.
 2.  Bilateral pleural pigtail catheters are again seen and are unchanged in
 position.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable in this
 postoperative patient status post median sternotomy with mitral valve
 annuloplasty.  Increasing opacity at right lung base and the costophrenic
 angle which could represent accumulating fluid or an area of evolving
 pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is advised.  No evidence of pulmonary edema. 
 Patchy opacities at left base likely reflects atelectasis.  No pneumothorax.
