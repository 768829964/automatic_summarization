                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff position.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the previous study, the Dobbhoff tube has been
 re-positioned so that the tip is just below the level of the esophagogastric
 junction.  It could well be pushed forward.
 
 No evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion.
