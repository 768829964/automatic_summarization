 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Radiograph centered at the thoracoabdominal junction was obtained
 for assessment of a feeding tube, which terminates in the distal stomach. 
 Left PICC has been re-positioned, now terminating in the mid superior vena
 cava.  Otherwise, little change since the recent study except for improved
 atelectasis at the left lung base, which is nearly resolved.
