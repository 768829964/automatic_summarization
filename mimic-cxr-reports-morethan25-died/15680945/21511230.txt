                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Cough with history of pulmonary fibrosis and Pseudomonas pneumonia. 
 
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies including the most recent chest CT from ___ and chest radiograph from ___.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Patchy opacities are again visualized throughout bilateral lungs with relative
 sparing of the left upper lobe and appear minimally improved in comparison to
 the prior study.  More focal opacity at the right upper lobe also appears
 minimally improved in comparison to the prior study.  A left-sided Port-A-Cath
 is again noted with the tip in the lower SVC.  Cardiac silhouette appears
 stable.   
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Minimal improvement in bilateral patchy opacities consistent with improving
 multilobar infectious or inflammatory process. Persistent consolidation is
 again noted in the right upper lobe.
