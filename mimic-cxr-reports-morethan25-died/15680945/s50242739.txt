                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ALL with pulmonary fibrosis and left lobe transplant with main stem
 bronchus tracheobronchomalacia and stent placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  Diffuse areas of multifocal pneumonia are again
 consistent with the clinical history.  These remain most prominent in the left
 mid and lower lung zone and in the right upper zone, where there appears to be
 some element of volume loss.
