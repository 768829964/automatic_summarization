                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 10:19 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumonia after intubation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to 7:10 p.m.:
 
 Endotracheal tube is close to the carina and should be withdrawn 2 cm for
 optimal positioning.  A subsequent chest radiograph available at the time of
 this review, performed 15 minutes later showed the tube positioned above the
 upper margin of the clavicles, 2 cm above optimal placement.
 
 Multifocal pneumonia, which has progressed since ___ is made to look
 more severe by mild concurrent pulmonary edema which has developed over the
 course of the day.  Left subclavian infusion port ends in the low SVC and a
 right internal jugular line closer to the level of the superior cavoatrial
 junction.  Nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.  Heart is partially obscured
 by adjacent pleural and parenchymal abnormalities including a moderate right
 pleural effusion, which along with a small left pleural effusion has developed
 since earlier in the day.
