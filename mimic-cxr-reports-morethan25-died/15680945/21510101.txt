                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient intubated with bilateral
 consolidations.
 
 ET tube tip is 5 cm above the carina.  Right internal jugular line tip is at
 the level of cavoatrial junction.  A left subclavian line tip is not clearly
 seen, most likely terminating at the same level as the right internal jugular
 line.
 
 As compared to the prior study from ___ there is no substantial
 change in the position of the left main bronchus stent.  Left mid and lower
 lung consolidation and right upper lobe consolidations are unchanged,
 extensive.  No interval development of substantial pleural effusion is seen. 
 No pneumothorax is identified.
