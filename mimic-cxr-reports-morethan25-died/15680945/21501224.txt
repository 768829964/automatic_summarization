                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Fever, cough and tachypnea.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, semi-upright AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the superior vena cava.  There is again
 a gastrostomy tube projecting over the left upper quadrant and cholecystectomy
 clips projecting over the right upper quadrant of the abdomen.  There is a
 device projecting over the upper mediastinum that presumably lies outside of
 the patient.  The heart is normal in size.  An increasing consolidation with
 marked volume loss of the right upper lobe persists with decreased aeration
 and greater opacification.  Volume loss is again associated with moderate
 relative elevation of the right hemidiaphragm.  In addition, there are vague
 patchy opacities which are new and widespread within each lung, especially in
 the left infrahilar region.  At least two of these appear nodular, although
 one of them is suggestive of a nipple shadow.  There is no definite pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing opacification of the right upper lobe with substantial
 volume loss and air bronchograms, in addition to widespread patchy opacities
 including patchy geographic and nodular opacities in the left lower lung. 
 This appearance could be seen with an infectious etiology including atypical
 forms of pneumonia.  
 
 Short-term followup radiographs are recommended to reassess, and particularly
 if suspicion for discrete nodules were to persist, then chest CT could be
 considered.
