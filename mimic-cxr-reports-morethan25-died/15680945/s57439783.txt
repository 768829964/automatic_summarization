                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS
 
 HISTORY:  Rapid heart rate and palpitations.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  A Port-A-Cath terminates in the lower superior vena cava, as
 before.  A stent is present in the left main stem bronchus.  Cholecystectomy
 clips project over the right upper quadrant.  A gastrostomy tube projects over
 the left upper quadrant.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged including rightward shift associated with volume loss in the right
 hemithorax.  Pleural thickening, opacification, and volume loss appear similar
 to the recent prior radiographs.  There is no pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
