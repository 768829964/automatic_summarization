                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  Recent abdominal pain and arrest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP supine.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is intubated.  The endotracheal tube terminates about 7 cm above
 the carina. A dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device is noted. A PICC line terminates
 in the uppermost right atrium. A chest tube projects over the right lower
 hemithorax. In both lungs, but greater on the right than left, there is upper
 lobe opacification with mild volume loss, including a vague rounded opacity of
 moderate size in the right upper lung. The heart is moderately enlarged. There
 is mild vascular congestion and the main pulmonary artery appears enlarged.
 Small pleural effusions are likely including minor probable left basilar
 atelectais.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Upper lobe opacities including a somewhat a rounded right upper lobe
 opacity. These findings are probably due to a pneumonia or recent substantial
 atelectasis but short-term followup radiographs are recommended to reassess
 and exclude a mass in the right upper lobe.
 
 2.  Small pleural effusions and probable left basilar atelectasis.
