                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 6:07
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with respiratory distress, now intubated.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 3:32.
 
 Semi-erect portable chest film ___ at 6:08 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Interval placement of an endotracheal tube with it tip 4.2 cm above the
 carina.  The nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the
 tip not identified.  A right subclavian PICC line continues to have its tip in
 the distal SVC. There are layering bilateral effusions with patchy air space
 disease in both lungs suggestive of worsening moderate pulmonary edema given
 the interval change.  A diffuse infectious process could also have this
 appearance and therefore clinical correlation is advised.  Overall cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are stable.  A dual left-sided pacemaker remains in
 place.  Prominent calcification in the aorta consistent with atherosclerosis. 
 Asymmetric left apical pleural thickening is stable and may represent some
 loculated fluid.
