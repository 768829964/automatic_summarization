                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Follow up effusion.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___, at 8:46 a.m.
 
 Compared to the study from one day earlier, there has been some clearing of
 opacity in the left lung, particularly in the upper and lower zones laterally.
 Again seen is a rounded area of lucency in the upper zone laterally and
 opacity which is confluent with the left hilum.  Also again seen is pleural
 fluid or thickening at the left lung apex and increased retrocardiac opacity
 with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm.  There is also diffuse increased
 opacity in the right lung with a perihilar and basilar distribution.  No gross
 right effusion.  Possible minimal clearing in the right cardiophrenic region. 
 
 
 A left-sided pacemaker is present with lead tips over the right atrium and
 right ventricle.  The right ventricular lead extends slightly beyond the edge
 of this film.  Tubing overlies the left chest, and on the prior film, this was
 associated with the pigtail in the left upper abdomen.  A PICC line is
 present, tip at SVC/RA junction.  D
 
 ense right greater than left carotid artery calcification is again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval improvement in opacification of the left lung and
 right lung base.  Cardiomegaly is similar to prior.  Findings could represent
 a combination of pneumonic consolidation and CHF.  Significance of the area of
 rounded lucency in the left upper lung is not fully evaluated on this exam. 
 No obvious bulla or abscess was seen in this area on the ___ CT scan. 
 Please see detailed assessment on recent chest CT study.
