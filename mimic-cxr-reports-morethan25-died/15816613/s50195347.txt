 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion s/p chest tube removal,
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ through ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since prior, there has been removal of the left chest tube with a new 10 mm
 left apical pneumothorax. Consolidation in the left upper lobe persists and
 could represent re-expansion edema or hemorrhage. Additionally, a developing
 consolidation in the right lower lobe and cardiomegaly suggests pulmonary
 edema.  Right PICC and right atrial and ventricular pacing wires are in
 standard position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. New small left apical pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
 
 2. Persistent left upper lobe consolidation may represent re-expansion edema
 or hemorrhage.
