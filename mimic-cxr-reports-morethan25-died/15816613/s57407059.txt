 PORTABLE CHEST, ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Moderate-to-large left pleural effusion has increased in size, and
 continues to have a loculated component adjacent to the left hilar and
 mediastinal contours.  Moderate right pleural effusion has also increased in
 size with pleural catheter in place.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by moderate pulmonary
 edema.  Worsening confluent opacities at the lung bases could represent
 dependent edema, aspiration or infection.
