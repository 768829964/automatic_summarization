                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Chest tubes, effusion followup.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable supine frontal radiograph of the chest demonstrates bilateral pleural
 pigtails, 1 in each base and 1 in the left mid hemithorax.  The pleural
 catheter at the left lung base has a kink in it.  3 left pneumothorax has
 slightly increased in size seen at the base and tracking along the
 mediastinum.  The right pleural effusion has largely cleared compared to the
 prior study.  Pulmonary edema has largely cleared; however, there is
 persistent opacification in the left upper lung which likely reflects a
 superimposed pneumonia although asymmetric edema is possible.  The right PICC
 is in unchanged position ending at the cavoatrial junction. Dual pacer leads
 are also in unchanged position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Clearing of edema with residual parenchymal opacification in the left
 upper lung concerning for superimposed pneumonia; although, asymmetric edema
 is possible.
 
 2.  Increase in size of left pneumothorax with possible kink of the left
 basilar chest tube.
 
 3.  Decreased right pleural effusion.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 11:25 AM, 15 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
