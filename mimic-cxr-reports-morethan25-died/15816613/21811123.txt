                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with effusion  // effusion f/u
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate right pleural effusion is reaccumulating despite the pigtail pleural
 drainage catheter at the lateral aspect of the right lung base, and mild
 pulmonary edema, somewhat asymmetric, has worsened since ___.
 
 There is no right pneumothorax. Previous right basal consolidation was
 dependent edema on ___ since it cleared dramatically later on
 ___. It recurred on ___ and is presumably edema once more. Otherwise
 I would suspect pneumonia. Only a small residual left pleural effusion
 remains, 3 pleural drains are still in place. Heart is mildly enlarged. No
 pneumothorax on either side. Transvenous right atrial and right ventricular
 pacer leads follow the expected courses.
