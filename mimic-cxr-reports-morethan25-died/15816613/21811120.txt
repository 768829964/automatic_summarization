                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusions, rising WBC  // Evaluate
 for worsening effusions, consolidations
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest, ___. Radiographs ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 The new sausage shaped homogeneous opacity projecting obliquely over the left
 mid hemi thorax is a fissural pleural fluid collection, developed since ___ following removal of the left pleural drains additional left pleural
 effusion has increased slightly at the left apex and may be collected
 inferiorly along the medial aspect of the lung and the descending thoracic
 aorta. The nature of the new left pleural effusion is indeterminate
 radiographically, but if it is empyema, that would explain new leukocytosis.
 Small right pleural effusion is basal, and represents overall smaller volume
 of pleural fluid following resolution of the components elsewhere in the right
 chest on ___. A substantial volume of left lower lobe atelectasis is
 present.
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Dr. ___ reported the findings to Dr. ___ by
 telephone on ___ at 2:47 PM, 2 minutes after discovery of the findings.
