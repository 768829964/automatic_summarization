                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Left pleural effusion status post pigtail placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There has been interval placement of a left pigtail catheter with
 minimal improved aeration of the left mid lung but persistent opacification of
 the remainder of the left hemithorax. The pigtail catheter appears somewhat
 folded distally. Large left pneumothorax is decreased in size with return of
 the mediastinum to midline. Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.  The
 left heart border is obscured and heart size is not well evaluated.  A left
 pacemaker has leads terminating in the right atrium and right ventricle. A
 right PICC terminates in the mid SVC.  Atelectasis at the right base is
 unchanged.  There is no large pneumothorax.  The thoracic aorta is calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large left pleural effusion is smaller with slight improvement in aeration
 of the left mid lung and return of the mediastinum to the midline. The pigtail
 catheter appears to be folded distally although this may be projectional. 
 
 2.  Right pleural effusion and right basilar atelectasis are unchanged.
