 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p thoracentesis  // r/o ptx

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has undergone left
 thoracocentesis. The effusion on the left is almost completely resolved.  The
 apical parenchymal opacities, partly with air bronchograms, are now again
 visualized in the full extent.
 
 The size of the cardiac silhouette, the mild right basal opacity, the signs of
 mild fluid overload and the left pectoral pacemaker are all unchanged.
