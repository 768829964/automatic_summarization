                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with effusion  // f/u effusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Large areas of consolidation persist in the right perihilar and both lower
 lung zones and suprahilar left upper lobe.  The left upper lobe abnormality
 improved following thoracentesis of the large left pleural effusion, but has
 not improved since ___.  This is concerning for the establishment of
 pneumonia in previous lobar collapse.
 
 The large areas of consolidation in both lower lobes have not changed
 appreciably over the past week.  CT scan on ___ suggested that at the
 time those abnormalities were due to severe atelectasis. That may still be the
 case.  When aeration is noptimized, CT scanning might be helpful to determine
 the extent of pneumonia and to evaluate the bronchi which were compromised on
 the ___ chest CT scan. The left basal pigtail pleural drain is still in
 place and residual left pleural fluid is moderate in volume or smaller, with a
 similar volume of pleural fluid on the right. Moderate cardiomegaly has not
 changed.
 
 Right PIC line ends in the lower SVC. Left trans subclavian atrioventricular
 pacer leads follow their expected courses from the left pectoral generator. No
 pneumothorax is present.
