                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  In addition to a pre-existing pigtail pleural catheter in the lower
 left hemithorax, a new pleural catheter has been placed in the periphery of
 the mid left hemithorax, with associated decrease in extent of loculated
 pleural fluid in the left juxtahilar region and left apex.  Persistent small
 loculated left basilar pneumothorax, and other previously described findings
 are generally similar to the prior recent radiograph except for improving
 aeration in the left juxtahilar and basilar regions.
