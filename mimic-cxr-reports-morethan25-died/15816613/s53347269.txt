                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with large pleural effusion
 and lung collapse.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior study obtained
 the same day earlier at 05:20 a.m.
 
 The left pigtail catheter has been placed.  The right PICC line tip is at the
 level of mid SVC.  Extensive consolidations are re-demonstrated.  There is no
 substantial change in overall appearance of the chest.  The left pleural
 effusion appears to be substantially decreased since the prior study, and
 there is minimal apical pneumothorax noted now after the substantial amount of
 apical pleural fluid component has been drained as well.
