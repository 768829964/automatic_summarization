                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Effusion.  Followup. 
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 8:19 a.m.
 
 Dual-lead pacemaker again noted with lead tips over right atrium and right
 ventricle.  PICC line tip at SVC/RA junction unchanged.
 
 Allowing for technical differences, I doubt significant interval change. 
 Again seen is a pigtail catheter at the left base, with left effusion. 
 Additional fluid is seen tracking along the left lung apex.  There is more
 diffuse opacity in both lungs, ? due to CHF or other pneumonic infiltrate. 
 There is trace fluid in the right costophrenic sulcus.  No pneumothorax is
 detected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Doubt significant change compared with ___ at 8:19 a.m.
