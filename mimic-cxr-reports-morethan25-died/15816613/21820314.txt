                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: Confirm PICC line placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 A PICC line is present.  The tip is not optimally visualized.  Allowing for
 this, it likely lies at the distal most SVC. Right-sided Pleurx catheter is
 again noted, similar to the prior film. No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 A dual-lead left-sided pacemaker is present, with lead tips over right atrium
 and right ventricle.  The trachea appears narrow with prominent surrounding
 soft tissue.  There is cardiomegaly, with a prominent pulmonary artery
 contour.  There is opacity including patchy opacity in the left lung,
 increased retrocardiac density and hazy opacity throughout much of the right
 lung.  There is a small left effusion and left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  There is a probable right effusion as well as collapse and/or
 consolidation at the right base medially.  
 
 Compared with a chest x-ray from ___ on ___, the pulmonary
 findings are similar, though the degree of hazy opacity in the right lung has
 increased.
