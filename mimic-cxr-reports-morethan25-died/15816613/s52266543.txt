                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Chronic pleural effusion.  Pleurx catheter, status post drainage,
 evaluate pleural effusion.
 
 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 9:35 a.m.
 
 Rotated positioning.  Catheter is again seen overlying the lower right chest
 medially consistent with a Pleurx catheter.  There has been some improvement
 in the degree of hazy opacity, suggesting some interval clearing, though the
 opacity remains visible.  Lateral view shows extensive opacification.  Lucency
 seen anteriorly is probably artifact, rather than pyx, given superimposition
 of different parts of the chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Slight interval improvement in the degree of opacification of the
 right lung.  Doubt pneumothorax.
