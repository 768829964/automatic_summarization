                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with intubation, multifactorial shock  // Eval ETT
 placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated considerably to the right.  Given this, interval placement
 of endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4 cm above the level
 of the carina.  Enteric tube courses below the level of the diaphragm into the
 left upper quadrant, presumed terminating in the stomach, with side port at
 the level of the GE junction.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 grossly stable given differences in patient position, with the cardiac
 silhouette enlarged.  There is persistent blunting of the right costophrenic
 angle.  Vascular prominence appears stable to possibly minimally decreased. 
 Chronic appearing left rib deformities are noted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Endotracheal tube terminates 4 cm above the level the carina.
 
 Enteric tube terminates in the left upper quadrant, presumed in the stomach;
 side port at the level the GE junction consider advancement so that it is well
 within the stomach.
