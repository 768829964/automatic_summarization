  Endotracheal tube terminates 4.5 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ETT, likely LLL collapse suspect has
 resolved after suctioning  // LLL collapse
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the prior study from earlier the same date, previously present
 complete left lung collapse has substantially improved with residual partial
 atelectasis of the left lower lobe.  Diffuse pulmonary edema has decreased in
 severity.  Moderate right and small to moderate left pleural effusions are
 noted.  Endotracheal tube is in standard position, and nasogastric tube has
 apparently been withdrawn with side-port potentially proximal to GE junction
 level.  This could be advanced a few cm for standard positioning.
