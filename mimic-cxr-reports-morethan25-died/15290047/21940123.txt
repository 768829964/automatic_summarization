                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p PEA arrest with multiple rib fx s/p CPR  //
 s/p paravertebral epidural block; PTX; ?interval change in R-sided effusion   
 s/p paravertebral epidural block; PTX; ?interval change in R-sided effusion
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Compared to chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions and severe chronic cardiomegaly may be
 slightly smaller.  Lung bases are poorly aerated, perhaps dependent edema and
 atelectasis, or consolidation or atelectasis.  Discrimination between these
 possibilities would require chest CT scanning.  No pneumothorax.
 
 ET tube in standard placement.  Right transjugular temporary pacer lead tip
 projects over the right ventricular apex.  Esophageal drainage tube ends in
 the upper portion of a nondistended stomach.
 
 Fractures are present in posterior of at least 4 left middle ribs.  Additional
 fractures are presumed, but not readily detected by conventional chest
 radiographs.
