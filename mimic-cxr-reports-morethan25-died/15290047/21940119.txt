 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dated most recently ___ as well as CTA chest dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates cardiomegaly, not significantly
 changed in size relative to CT chest dated ___.  Obscuration of
 the bilateral costophrenic angles likely suggest small pleural effusions,
 right greater than left.  Central vascular engorgement is present with
 probable mild to moderate pulmonary edema.  There is no pneumothorax.  Clips
 are noted superiorly in the expected location of the thyroid gland in this
 patient status post thyroidectomy.
