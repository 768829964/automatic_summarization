                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman s/p cardiac arrest  // ? ptx, effusion,
 consolidation      ? ptx, effusion, consolidation
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change. 
 The monitoring and support devices are stable, as is the appearance of the
 heart and lungs.  An area of lucency in the left lung laterally most likely
 represents a skin fold rather than pneumothorax, since vessels are seen
 filling beyond it.
