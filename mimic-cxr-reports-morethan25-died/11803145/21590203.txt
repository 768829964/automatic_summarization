 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Interval removal of right-sided chest tube, with no evidence of
 right pneumothorax.  Left chest tube remains in place, with slight worsening
 of small-to-moderate basilar lateral pneumothorax.  Patchy and linear
 opacities in the mid lung regions show interval continued improvement on the
 right, but slight worsening on the left.  Otherwise, no relevant change since
 recent study.
