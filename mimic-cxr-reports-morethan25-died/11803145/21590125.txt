                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Septic shock, multifocal pneumonia and pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 There has been interval worsening of atelectasis now probably collapse of the
 left lower lobe.  The cardiomediastinum is shifted towards the left.  Small
 left pneumothorax is unchanged.  Bilateral chest tubes are noted.  The right
 now projects more medially than before.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The
 left hemidiaphragm is elevated.  ET tube is in standard position.  Right
 central catheter tip is in the lower SVC.  Multifocal opacities in the right
 lung are grossly unchanged.
