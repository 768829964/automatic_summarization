                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Empyema, ventilator associated pneumonia, and bilateral chest tubes,
 on mechanical ventilation.  Evaluate for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs dating back to ___, the
 most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 A portable frontal chest radiograph again demonstrates bilateral chest tubes,
 a nasogastric tube, and right PICC, all of which are unchanged in position. 
 The left central catheter has been exchanged.  Increased right lower lung
 linear opacities likely represent increased atelectasis.  There is improved
 aeration of the left lower lobe, but increased lingular atelectasis.  A small
 to moderate loculated left pleural effusion is persistent, and there is a
 small right pleural effusion which is new or slightly increased.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Increased right base and lingular atelectasis, with improved aeration of
 the left lower lobe.
 
 2. Persistent loculated small to moderate left pleural effusion, and new or
 slightly increased small right pleural effusion.
