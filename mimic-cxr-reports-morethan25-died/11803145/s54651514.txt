                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___ AT 8:41 A.M.
 
 COMPARISON:  Study of earlier the same date.
 
 FINDINGS:  Small left apical pneumothorax and small lateral basilar component
 adjacent to left chest tube appear slightly smaller, but positional
 differences could potentially contribute to this apparent change.  Exam
 otherwise appears similar to the recent study except for slight worsening of
 multifocal lung opacities, particularly at the lung bases.
