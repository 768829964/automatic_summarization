                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:24 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with empyema.  Evaluate the right lung after
 placing chest tube to waterseal.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Right pleural tube still traverses the right mid hemithorax, with its tip
 impinging on the mediastinum just to the left of midline.  Left pleural tube
 inclined obliquely ending at the level of the aortic arch is unchanged. 
 Atelectasis in the left lung is probably responsible for the bulk of leftward
 mediastinal shift, exaggerated by rotation.  Small left pleural effusion is
 present.  There is no appreciable right pleural effusion or pneumothorax on
 either side.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  Right subclavian
 line ends in the mid SVC, and upper enteric drainage tube passes into the
 stomach and out of view.  A left jugular line is unchanged in position more
 lateral than generally seen probably a reflection of anatomic variation.
