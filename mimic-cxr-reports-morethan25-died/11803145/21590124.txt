                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Multifocal pneumonia, bilateral chest tubes, and
 pneumothorax.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Multifocal consolidations have improved in the lower lobes.  Small left
 pneumothorax has decreased in size.  Bilateral chest tubes are in unchanged
 position.  ET tube is in standard position.  Right subclavian catheter tip is
 in the lower SVC.  NG tube tip is in the fundus of the stomach. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is still shifted towards the left, unchanged. 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.
