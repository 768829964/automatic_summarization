                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left chest tube remains in place, with increasing small-to-moderate
 left apical and lateral pneumothorax.  Stable cardiomegaly and pulmonary
 vascular congestion accompanied by persistent left perihilar opacity but
 worsening diffuse airspace opacities in the right lung.  It is uncertain
 whether the latter reflects asymmetrical pulmonary edema or a superimposed
 process such as aspiration.  Small right pleural effusion is unchanged.
