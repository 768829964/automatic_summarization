                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Evaluation of central line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Outside hospital reference chest CT and chest radiograph.
 
 PORTABLE SUPINE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube ends 3 cm
 above the carina.  The nasogastric tube ends in the stomach.  A new right
 subclavian line ends at the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins.  A
 right-sided chest tube crosses midline and ends projecting over the heart.  A
 left-sided chest tube ends in the  lung apex.  Bilateral airspace opacities in
 the right upper lobe, right lower lobe and left lower lobe are noted.  There
 are probably small pleural effusions.  There is a moderate left lateral
 pneumothorax, unchnaged. There is no free air beneath the right hemidiaphragm.
 The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The aortic knob is calcified.Bilateral
 airspace opacities are concerning for multifocal aspiration and/or pneumonia
