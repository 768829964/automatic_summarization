                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 4:04 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with multifocal pneumonia and renal failure. 
 Evaluate for interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Appearance of the chest has not changed very much since ___. 
 Heterogeneous opacification in the right lung is probably not pneumonia or
 atelectasis.  Left lower lobe is densely consolidated and abnormality in the
 lingula, probably atelectasis, obscures left heart border.  The heart is
 mildly to moderately enlarged, but remains shifted into the left hemithorax,
 presumably because of atelectasis.  No appreciable pneumothorax. 
 Small-to-moderate left pleural effusion is probably still present.  Lines and
 tubes are unchanged in their respective positions.
