                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Septic shock, for tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  Left chest tube is again seen with a moderate left
 lateral pneumothorax.  No evidence of pneumothorax on the right with chest
 tube in place.
 
 Otherwise, little change in the appearance of the heart and lungs.  Extensive
 opacification at the left base is consistent with volume loss in the lower
 lobe and pleural fluid.
