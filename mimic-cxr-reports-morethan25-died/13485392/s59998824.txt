                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chronic respiratory failure  // tubes/lines,
 acute intrapulmonary process      tubes/lines, acute intrapulmonary process
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since the end of ___, most recently ___:15.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Improvement in generalized level of radiodensity in the lungs over 24 hr is
 presumably due to improvement in the component that is due to recover verbal
 pulmonary edema, but the severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality, probably
 largely pulmonary fibrosis, is of course unchanged.  Pleural effusions small
 if any.  No pneumothorax.  Tracheostomy tube midline.  Right PIC line ends in
 the mid to low SVC.
