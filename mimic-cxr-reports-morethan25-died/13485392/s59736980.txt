                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF exac, ILD  // Progression of pulmonary
 edema, any new consolidations
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are unchanged compared to the prior study.  A left internal
 jugular catheter terminates in the proximal SVC.  There are persistent
 extensive bilateral airspace opacities with cystic areas.  The appearances are
 most consistent with a background interstitial lung disease with superimposed
 pulmonary edema.  The extent of airspace opacity is similar to slightly worse
 when compared to the prior study.  No definite pleural effusion seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal contour cannot be evaluated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Similar to slightly worsening bilateral airspace opacities.
