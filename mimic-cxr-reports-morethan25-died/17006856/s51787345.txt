                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with seizures, resp failure  // int change
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph cough frontal view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 32 mm above the carina.  Right PICC terminates mid SVC. 
 The transesophageal tube terminates in the stomach.  Large left pleural
 effusion is increased.  Left lower lobe is collapsed with left mediastinal
 shift.  Right base atelectasis is less severe compared to the left.  There is
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  Moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged. 
 There is pleural fluid collection in the right major fissure.  Cardiac
 silhouette is obscured by pleural effusions.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Left lower lobe is collapsed with left mediastinal shift.  Right lung base
 atelectasis is less severe compared to left.  Superimposed pneumonia is
 possible in correct clinical setting.
 
 2. Large left pleural effusions increased.    Moderate right pleural effusion
 is stable.
 
 3.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is reflective of cardiac decompensation.
