                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___F coughing up sputum today, course breath sounds, evaluate for
 PNA  // ___F coughing up sputum today, course breath sounds, evaluate for PNA
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Compared to the prior exam from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Overall, compared to the most recent prior exam, there has been interval
 improvement in the consolidation at the right lung base, with residual
 consolidation on the current study.  Streaky linear opacity at the left lung
 base is likely secondary to atelectasis.  There is no large pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall, although there appears to be improvement in consolidation at the
 right lung base from the most recent prior exam from ___, residual
 consolidation is still identified.  This could be secondary to an infectious
 process.
 
 Left basilar atelectasis.
