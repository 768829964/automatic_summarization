                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT 4:34AM
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with alcoholic cirrhosis and esophageal
 varices with an intraparenchymal hemorrhage, evaluate for infectious process.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:34AM is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There is persistent consolidation in the left lower lobe, right lower lung
 and in the left upper lobe, which when compared to the prior study, appears to
 have slightly worsened being more linear at the right base and more
 consolidative in the left upper lung.  Although this could represent
 asymmetric pulmonary edema, an infectious process should also be considered. 
 Given the linear nature at the right base, this would suggest a component of
 atelectasis at least in this vicinity.  Findings in the left lung are
 concerning for a pneumonia.  The heart remains enlarged.  Mediastinal contours
 are unchanged.  The endotracheal tube is unchanged in position and a
 nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm with the tip not
 identified.  No large pneumothorax is appreciated.  Overall, the pulmonary
 vasculature appears slightly less congested suggesting resolving superimposed
 edema.
