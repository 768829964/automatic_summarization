                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:27 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old with alcoholic cirrhosis, esophageal varices, cerebral
 hemorrhage and herniation.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Although pulmonary consolidation has worsened appreciably in both lungs,
 moderate cardiomegaly is more severe and mediastinal veins more dilated, the
 marked asymmetry and consolidation strongly suggests worsening left pneumonia
 and perhaps a new pneumonia in the right lower lobe.  ET tube and right
 internal jugular line are in standard placements.  Upper enteric drainage tube
 ends in a non-distended stomach.  Moderate left and small-to-moderate right
 pleural effusions have increased.  No pneumothorax.
