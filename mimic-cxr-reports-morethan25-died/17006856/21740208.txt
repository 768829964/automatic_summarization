                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  CHEST, SINGLE SUPINE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Altered mental status and now intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube is seen, terminating approximately 4.2 cm above
 the level of the carina.  Nasogastric tube is seen extending into the expected
 location of the stomach.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  There is
 widening of the mediastinum which may relate to prominent vasculature;
 however, aortic or other mediastinal injury is not entirely excluded.  If
 there is clinical concern for such, consider chest CTA.  There is a linear
 left base opacity most likely represents atelectasis, although a component of
 aspiration is not excluded.  There is central pulmonary vascular engorgement. 
 No large pleural effusion is seen.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  No
 displaced fracture is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Enlarged cardiomediastinal silhouette.  If there is concern for acute
 aortic or other mediastinal process, consider chest CTA.  Central pulmonary
 vascular engorgement.
 
 2.  Likely left base atelectasis, although aspiration not excluded.
