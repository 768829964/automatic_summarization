                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___F with ileus
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low.  Heart size is accentuated as a result of low lung
 volumes and appears mildly to moderately enlarged, unchanged.  Crowding of the
 bronchovascular structures is noted without overt pulmonary edema. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases likely reflect areas of atelectasis.  No focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is present.  Oral contrast material is seen within
 the stomach.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Low lung volumes with probable bibasilar atelectasis.
