                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 535  
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with intraparenchymal hemorrhage.  Evaluate
 for change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 535 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval removal of the right internal jugular central line.  The
 endotracheal tube is unchanged in position with its tip approximately 3 cm
 above the carina.  A nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm
 with the tip not identified.  There is persistent bibasilar airspace disease
 with associated layering effusions, but overall there has been some interval
 improvement in aeration in the left mid upper lung.  These findings therefore
 more likely represent an improvement in moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema
 rather than an infectious process.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely unchanged, although somewhat difficult to assess due to the bibasilar
 airspace consolidation.  No pneumothorax.
