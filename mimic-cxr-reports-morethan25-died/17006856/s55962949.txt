 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are extremely low lung
 volumes with elevation of the hemidiaphragmatic contours.  Bibasilar
 atelectatic changes are seen.  There is some engorgement of pulmonary vessels,
 which could represent some elevated pulmonary venous pressure or merely be a
 reflection of low lung volumes.
 The nodules seen on the CT of this date cannot be well appreciated on plain
 radiographs.
