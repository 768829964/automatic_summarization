 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with esophageal rupture, mediastinitis, and
 bronchoesophageal fistula recently extubated and increasingly hypoxic  //
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the prior radiograph performed yesterday afternoon, the patient has been
 extubated.  The right-sided chest tubes are unchanged in position.  Right PICC
 line terminates in the right axillary vein. There is a millimetric right
 apical pneumothorax, not significantly changed compared to yesterday's study. 
 There is no pneumothorax on the left.  There are bibasilar opacities, which
 may be due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis.
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette remains enlarged.  A right-sided 7th rib fracture
 is re- demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Stable millimetric right apical pneumothorax.
 2.  Previously malpositioned right PICC line now terminates in the right
