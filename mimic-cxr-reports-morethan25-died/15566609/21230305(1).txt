                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with  distal esophageal perforation s/p repair of
 perf, washout, and intercostal muscle flap c/b leaking s/p clip stent on
 ___  // rule out acute changes/ pneumothorax, affusion     rule out acute
 changes/ pneumothorax, affusion
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at ___:54
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable upright chest film ___ at 10:59 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Three right chest tubes remain in place and there is a small right apical and
 lateral pneumothorax which may be slightly larger when compared to the most
 recent prior study, although this could be related to differences in
 positioning. Followup imaging should be considered. Left subclavian PICC line
 is unchanged. Heart remains stably enlarged. There is residual but improving
 mild interstitial and perihilar edema. Layering effusion on the left with
 associated retrocardiac opacity is stable consistent with partial lower lobe
 atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.
