                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation and transfer from outside hospital.
 
 COMPARISON:  Earlier on the same day.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, supine AP portable.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient is intubated.  An endotracheal tube terminates approximately 5 cm
 above the carina.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged including widening of the mediastinum and substantial cardiomegaly.
 Mild perhilar congestion appears unchanged.  There are possibly small pleural
 effusions and the base of the chest is difficult to assess owing to
 cardiomegaly and soft tissue attenuation.  There has been no significant
 change aside from endotracheal intubation.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Status post endotracheal intubation.  Findings suggest mild fluid overload.
