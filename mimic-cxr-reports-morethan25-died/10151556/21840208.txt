                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ y/o hypotension on balloon pump  // ___ y/o hypotension on
 balloon pump
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable Chest radiograph, frontal view
 
 COMPARISON:  None available.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 4 cm above the carina.  Radiodense tip of the balloon pump
 terminates near the level of aortic arch.  Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in
 the right pulmonary artery.  There are opacities in the left lung and right
 upper lung, which probably represent asymmetric pulmonary edema.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Asymmetric opacities in the lung is probably moderate pulmonary edema, however
 underlying pulmonary contusion, pneumonia, or aspiration is also possible in
 correct clinical setting.
