                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis with bleed post-paracentesis, evaluate lines and tubes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___, CT abdomen and
 pelvis ___.
 
 FINDINGS: The ET tube has been withdrawn, now in standard position
 approximately 5 cm above the carina.  An enteric tube is seen in standard
 position with distal tip in the stomach.  A right IJ catheter is present with
 tip near the cavoatrial junction.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours
 are stable.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The left
 retrocardiac opacity persists and remains unchanged, representing near
 complete collapse of the left lower lobe.  There is no new focal consolidation
 concerning for pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. ET tube in standard position.
 2. Persistent near complete collapse of the left lower lobe.
