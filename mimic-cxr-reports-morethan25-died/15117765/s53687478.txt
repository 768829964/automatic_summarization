                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with ethanol cirrhosis, on mechanical
 ventilation.  Evaluate for interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ through ___
 and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates 3.5 cm above the carina, likely
 related to chin positioning.  A right IJ central venous catheter terminates in
 the mid-to-low SVC.  A right PICC line terminates at the confluence of the
 brachiocephalic veins.  An enteric line courses below the diaphragm, tip is
 not included in this examination.  Note is made of decreased lung volume on
 the right. Persistent retrocardiac and left lower lobe opacities are likely
 related to collapse of the left lower lung and overlying pleural fluid.  No
 new focal consolidations or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: Persistent retrocardiac and left lung base opacities likely
 reflect collapse of the left lower lung with overlying pleural fluid. No new
 focal consolidations.
