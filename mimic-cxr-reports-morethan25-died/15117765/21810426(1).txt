                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the Dobbhoff
 tube has been pushed forward to the mid body of the stomach, where it coils on
 itself slightly.  Nasogastric tube remains in place.
 
 There is increasing opacification in the left hemithorax with shift of the
 mediastinum to the left, consistent with a recurrent attack of mucus plugging
 with substantial volume loss in the left lung.  
 
 This was telephoned to Dr. ___ in the MICU.
