                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Decompensated liver disease, MICU.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 On the first x-ray, the new Dobbhoff tube is in the right main stem.  On the
 subsequent x-ray done 10 minutes afterwards, the Dobbhoff tube has been
 removed.  The right-sided PICC line has been slightly pulled back and ends at
 the junction of subclavian vein and superior vena cava.  Considering the
 different positioning of the patient, the left lower lobe collapse is still
 severe and not changed significantly.  There is probably a small left pleural
 effusion adjacent to it.  The right lung is unremarkable.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
