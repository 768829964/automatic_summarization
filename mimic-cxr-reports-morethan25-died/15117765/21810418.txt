                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest single semi-erect portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Cirrhosis, ascites, intubated.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 3.8 cm above the level
 of the carina.  Enteric tube is seen coursing below the level of the
 diaphragm, inferior aspect not included on the image.  There has been interval
 placement of a right-sided PICC which terminates in the proximal to mid SVC
 without evidence of pneumothorax.  There are low lung volumes.  There is left
 pleural effusion.  Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are similar given
 difference in patient's position and technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Lines and tubes as above without evidence of pneumothorax.
 2.  Low lung volumes and left pleural effusion.
