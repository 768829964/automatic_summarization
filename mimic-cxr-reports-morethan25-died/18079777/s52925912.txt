                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with PICC, chronic vent p/w bacteremia  // eval for
 pneumonia, PICC placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Patient is rotated somewhat to the right.  Tracheostomy tube is noted. 
 Enteric tube is seen terminating at the GE junction, recommend advancement so
 that it is well within the stomach.  Left-sided PICC terminates in the low SVC
 without evidence of pneumothorax.  There are small to moderate bilateral
 pleural effusions.  The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting chronic
 obstructive pulmonary disease. Right base opacity could be due to combination
 of pleural effusion and atelectasis, but consolidation is not excluded in the
 appropriate clinical setting. There is also subtle right perihilar opacity. 
 Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are unremarkable.  Multiple chronic
 appearing left-sided rib deformities seen.
