                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)

 ulcer with known AVM at G-E junction and extensive esophagitis, who presented
 with hematemesis. Now s/p trach placement ___  // s/p trach placement ___   
 s/p trach placement ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been a tracheostomy
 placed with no evidence of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.  The right
 subclavian catheter again extends to the mid portion of the SVC and the
 enteric tube coils within the mid to upper stomach.  .
 The left pigtail catheter is been removed and there is no definite evidence
 for pneumothorax.  There is increasing opacification at the left base, most
 likely consistent with pleural effusion atelectasis.  The right lung remains
 essentially clear.
