 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right internal jugular central line has its tip in the distal SVC.  There
 continues to be a layering left effusion with patchy associated airspace
 opacity which could reflect compressive lower lobe atelectasis, although
 pneumonia should also be considered.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours
 are likely stable.  A more subtle patchy opacity the right medial lung base is
 suggestive of atelectasis.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax. Multiple
 left-sided rib deformities consistent with remote trauma.
