 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the earlier study, the endotracheal tube has been pushed
 forward so that the tip now lies approximately 4 cm above the carina.  There
 has been progressive re-expansion of the left hemithorax, with now all
 relatively mild volume loss at the base and pleural fluid.  The mediastinal
 structures are essentially mid line at this time.
 The right lung is essentially clear.
 Multiple rib fractures are again seen on the left.
