                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with chest tube  // please eval chest tube     
 please eval chest tube
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 03:49
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable semi-erect chest radiograph ___ at 07:36 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Tubes and lines are unchanged in position with the left basilar pigtail
 catheter unchanged in position.  Minimal blunting of both costophrenic angles
 likely reflect tiny effusions.  No pneumothorax is appreciated, although the
 sensitivity to detect pneumothorax is diminished given semi-erect technique. 
 Lungs appear well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation or
 pulmonary edema.  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  Multiple old
 left-sided posterolateral rib fractures.
