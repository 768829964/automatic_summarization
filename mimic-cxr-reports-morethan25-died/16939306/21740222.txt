 Small left pleural effusion is smaller today than on ___.  Is no
 appreciable right pleural effusion.  Right hemidiaphragm remains mildly
 elevated.  The area of increased radiodensity projecting over the right
 midlung laterally could be due to subtle consolidation in the lung pleural
 fluid but could also be due to chest soft tissue in duration, perhaps related
 to the indwelling right subclavian infusion catheter.  Clinical correlation
 advised.  Conventional PA and lateral chest radiographs of strongly
 recommended.
