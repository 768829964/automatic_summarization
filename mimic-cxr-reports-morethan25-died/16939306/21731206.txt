                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p tbbx.  // assess ptx and bleeding.     
 assess ptx and bleeding.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper lobe consolidation which developed after ___ is a little
 more extensive today than on ___, now reaching the minor fissure, and
 partially obscuring what was an initially much more radiodense nodular region
 at the upper aspect of the abnormality, at the level of the first anterior
 rib.  Findings suggest continued bleeding.  Mild cardiomegaly is stable, but
 pulmonary vascular congestion has worsened.  There is progressive
 opacification at the base of the left lung, probably a combination of
 atelectasis and pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Right subclavian infusion port ends in the low SVC.
