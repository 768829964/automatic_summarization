                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPHS 
 
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, immunosuppression and large hematoma along the right chest.
 Question pneumonia or rib fracture.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP upright and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a dual-lead pacemaker/ICD device with leads terminating in
 the right atrium and ventricle, respectively.  The heart is mildly enlarged. 
 Patchy calcification is noted along the aortic arch.  There is no definite
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax, although there is persistent blunting of the
 right costophrenic angle, which may suggest a small persistent loculated
 pleural effusion versus scarring.  Slight thickening of the minor fissure is
 unchanged.  The lungs appear clear.  Bony structures are unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of acute disease.
