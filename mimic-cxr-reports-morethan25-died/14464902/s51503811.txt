                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with status post cardiac arrest, question
 infection. 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the prior exam, continued asymmetric resorption
 of the pulmonary edema has occurred. While opacities still exist, given the
 rate of resorption, it would be premature to call this pneumonia, although
 this is a possibility. No pleural effusion is present.  Cardiac size is still
 enlarged.  Pacemaker leads terminating in unchanged correct position. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improvement in the previously mild pulmonary edema.
