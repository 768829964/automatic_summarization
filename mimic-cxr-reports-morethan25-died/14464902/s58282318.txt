                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of liver and kidney transplant with acute dyspnea and
 hypoxia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Again seen is hazy opacification of the bilateral lungs, most
 likely representing pulmonary edema, although may be infection, ARDS, or
 pulmonary hemorrhage.  The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged and
 stable.  Small bilateral effusions are unchanged.  An opacification at the
 right base most likely represents atelectasis, although a developing infection
 cannot be excluded.  There is no pneumothorax.  Pacemaker electrodes are in
 standard position.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Unchanged moderate pulmonary edema and pleural effusions.
 2.  Probable right basilar atelectasis although developing pneumonia cannot be
 excluded.
