                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, CT abdomen and pelvis ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph, single view.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is little change compared to a prior study.  Heart size
 remains mildly enlarged.  Hilar contours are unremarkable.  Mild interstitial
 edema is unchanged.  There is a small right pleural effusion.  Endotracheal
 tube and right PICC line are in appropriate position.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Small amount of pneumoperitoneum is present, likely from recent
 PEG tube placement and was also present on recent CT examination.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Little change compared to a prior examination with
 re-demonstration of minimal interstitial edema and small right effusion.  No
 focal consolidation worrisome for infectious process.  Trace pneumoperitoneum
 is likely from recent PEG tube placement.
