                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Altered mental status.  Evaluate for acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST:  The support devices have been
 removed.  The heart remains mildly enlarged.  There is no pleural effusion,
 pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation.  Streaky opacities in the lung
 bases are non-specific and may reflect sequela from prior infection or
 atelectasis.  The mediastinum and hilar structures are unremarkable.  Clips
 are seen within the neck.  A gastrostomy tube and cholecystectomy clips are
 noted.
