                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status epilepticus, intubated for 10 days.  Assess interval
 change.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  ET tube remains in standard position.  An enteric tube is present
 with tip in the stomach, but side port in the esophagus. Cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are stable with moderate cardiomegaly. There is no pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax.  There is worsening consolidation in the right upper
 lobe, consistent with pneumonia.  Cephalization may be physiologic in a supine
 position. Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Worsening right upper lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia.
 2.  Enteric tube should be advanced 5 cm to place the side port in the
 stomach.
