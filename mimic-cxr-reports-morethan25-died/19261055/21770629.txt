                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Seizure, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral views of the chest again mild demonstrate patchy
 opacification in the left lung base, which is likely atelectasis.  There is no
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  Previously seen right sided PICC is no longer seen.  Cholecystectomy
 clips are noted within the right upper quadrant.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Patchy opacification left lung base may represent atelectasis, although,
 aspiration cannot be excluded.
