                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Tremors, recent surgery.  Seizure.  Evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors from ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate mild cardiomegaly,
 improved when compared to prior examinations.  There is no pulmonary vascular
 congestion or evidence of pulmonary edema.  The lungs are clear and there is
 no pneumothorax.  Surgical clips are noted in the right upper quadrant.
 Sclerotic appearance to lower thoracic vertebrae appears to also involve the

 can be more completely evaluated with frontal and lateral views of the Lumbar
 spine.
