                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with ESRD here to initiate hemodialysis //
 baseline CXR, dialysis fellow requested
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema and pulmonary vascular congestion. Mild to
 moderate cardiomegaly.  No pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Surgical clips
 over the upper neck related prior thyroid surgery.  Heterogeneous diffusely
 sclerotic bone with sclerosis of bilateral subchondral humeral heads.  Note is
 also made of an absent spleen and prior cholecystectomy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse mild interstitial abnormality likely pulmonary edema.
 
 Bilateral mild sclerosis of the humeral heads can be avascular necrosis.
 
 Diffuse sclerosis of the bones likely due to patients known diagnosis ESRD and
 sickle cell disease.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  Repeat radiograph after hemodialysis could be considered
 to ensure resolution of interstitial abnormality.
