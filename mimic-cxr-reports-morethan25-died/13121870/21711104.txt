 secretions. Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable frontal chest radiograph
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube projects over the midline of the upper thoracic
 trachea.Again seen is a moderate-sized left pleural effusion. Streaky left
 perihilar opacities while possibly representing atelectasis, could represent
 infection.  Retrocardiac opacification likely represents left lower lobe
