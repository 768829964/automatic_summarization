 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx COPD now s/p cervical spine lami and
 fusion (posterior).  Now with desaturation, poor cough, airway movement.  //
 Concern for atelectasis, infiltrate or congestion.     Concern for
 atelectasis, infiltrate or congestion.
 
 COMPARISON:  There are no prior chest radiographs available.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left lower lobe is airless, and the mediastinum shifted mildly to the left. 
 This indicates a large component of atelectasis, although pneumonia is not
 excluded. Left pleural effusion is small.  A small region of peribronchial
 opacification in the right lower lobe could be due to aspiration or early
 pneumonia. Heart size is normal. No pneumothorax.
