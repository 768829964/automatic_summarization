                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post intubation with oxygen desaturation and decreased
 breath sounds of the left.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient remains intubated. The endotracheal tube terminates approximately
 6 cm above the carina, as before. An orogastric tube courses into the stomach,
 its distal course not imaged, below the inferior margin of the film. A
 left-sided PICC line terminates at the cavoatrial junction. There is
 persistent confluent retrocardiac opacification with a small or perhaps
 small-to-moderate layering pleural effusion. Allowing for small differences in
 technique, findings are probably unchanged. There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent left lower lobe opacification, in a pattern which is very commonly
 due to atelectasis although an infectious process is not excluded, with
 pleural effusion.
