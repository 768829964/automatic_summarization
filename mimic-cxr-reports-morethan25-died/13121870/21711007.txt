 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with COPD, pneumonia  // eval for interval change
 eval for interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again is hyperexpansion of the
 lungs with little change in the appearance of the monitoring and support
 devices. Substantial collapse of the left lower lobe is again seen with
 retrocardiac opacification. Blunting of the costophrenic angle is consistent
 with some pleural effusion. The right lung is essentially clear and there is
 no evidence of vascular congestion.
