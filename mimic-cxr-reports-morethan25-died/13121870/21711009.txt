                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with aspiration pneumonia, s/p bronch.  // assess
 interval change s/p bronch
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The feeding tube terminates in the stomach. Endotracheal tube terminates at
 the level of the clavicles.  Aeration of the left lung has improved, and the
 left pleural effusion has substantially decreased. Mild persistent left
 basilar retrocardiac airspace opacification is likely due to resolving
 aspiration pneumonia. Mildly increased opacification at the medial right lung
 base may also be due to new or worsening aspiration.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Substantial interval improvement in bilateral aspiration pneumonia as since ___. However, there may be new or worsening aspiration at the right
 base.
