 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to previous studies there is prominence of interstitial lung
 markings consistent with known interstitial lung disease which is relatively
 stable told given the extent of interstitial lung disease would make it
 difficult to exclude a superimposed pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged compared to previous studies.  There is no

 position.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Grossly stable interstitial lung disease though difficult to exclude
 superimposed pneumonia in the right clinical setting.
