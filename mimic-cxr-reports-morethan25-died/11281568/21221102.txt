                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with endotracheal tube and probable infection. 
 Evaluate for endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from outside institution from ___ and
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal supine chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There are bilateral diffuse linear opacities with associated hilar
 engorgement compatible with pulmonary edema.  This is significantly worsened
 compared with chest radiograph from outside institution from ___ and ___.  More focal consolidation in the lung bases is present and
 suggestive of baseline interstitial lung disease.  No clear pleural effusions
 are identified.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are unremarkable.  An endotracheal tube ends 9 mm above the carina. 
 Of note, the balloon of the endotracheal tube is inflated to 2.5 cm and the
 diameter of the trachea just above the carina appears to be 1.6 cm. An
 esophageal tube is not clearly followed throughout its course but the tip
 might be just below the gastroesophageal junction.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Acute pulmonary edema, significantly worsened compared with radiograph
 performed two hours prior to this exam, on the background of bibasilar
 interstitial lung disease.
 
 2.  Endotracheal tube ends 9 mm above the carina.  Withdrawal of approximately
 2 cm is recommended for proper placement.
 
 3.  9 mm discrepancy between the caliber of the balloon of the EET and the
 caliber of the distal trachea.
