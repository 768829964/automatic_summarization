 AP CHEST, 4:15 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with HIV infection and pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Diffuse interstitial pulmonary abnormality is improving.  The combination of
 diffuse ground-glass opacification and peripheral coarse interstitial
 abnormality suggests acute involvement and chronic residua of pneumocystis

 standard placement.  No pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.
