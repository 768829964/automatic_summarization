                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with neurologic toxoplasmosis and tracheostomy. 
 Study requested for evaluation of tracheostomy and for new infiltrates.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___
 and chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS: Patient is somewhat rotated in this examination. A tracheostomy tube
 is seen well positioned in the trachea. Left subclavian catheter extends to
 the mid portion of the SVC.  Enteric tube courses below the diaphragm, the tip
 is not included in this examination.  Allowing for positional changes,
 cardiomediastinal and hilar contours appear normal.  No definite pleural
 effusions or pneumothorax. Lower lung volumes exaggerate interstitial
 abnormalities present at lung bases, likely representative of fibrosis and
 alveolitis which is fully characterized on prior chest CT from ___.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Lower lung volumes exaggerate interstitial abnormalities present
 at lung bases.  No new focal consolidations are identified.
