                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with HIV and toxoplasmosis.  Study requested for
 evaluation of new infiltrate in the setting of new fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___
 and from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube terminates 6 cm above the carina. A left-sided
 PICC line tip terminates at the level of the mid SVC. The cardiomediastinal
 and hilar contours are within normal limits.   Diffuse parenchymal opacities
 have improved on current chest x-ray when compared to recent and more remote
 examinations.  There are no new focal consolidations.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval improvement of parenchymal opacities which likely
 represent a diffuse process potentially infectious in origin and for which
 etiologies include opportunistic or conventional organisms.  No new focal
 consolidations.
