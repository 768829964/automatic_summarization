                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 4:28 A.M., ___.
 
 HISTORY:  HIV, cryptococcus.  Evaluate infiltrate.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Severe infiltrative pulmonary abnormality has improved early in ___, and has
 been relatively stable since.  The relatively global involvement of the upper
 lungs with ground-glass opacification and the denser peribronchial
 infiltration in the lower lungs is only mildly worse today than it was in
 ___, when a chest CT was done.  As such, I think most of what we see
 on conventional radiographs is chronic fibrosing lung disease and there may be
 a recent exacerbation of viral or other infection.
 
 There is no appreciable pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal, given the
 exceedingly low lung volumes.
 
 Tracheostomy tube in standard placement.  Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC. 
 No pneumothorax.
