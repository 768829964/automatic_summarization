                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cerebral toxoplasmosis.  Study requested for
 evaluation of trach and interval changes.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs from ___ through ___
 and prior chest CT from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE: Portable semi erect AP chest radiograph. 
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube is seen well positioned in the trachea.  A left
 PICC line extends to the mid portion of the SVC.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar
 contours are normal. Lower lung volumes exaggerate bibasilar opacities which
 appear more confluent and severe on today's examination. There is increased
 mild pulmonary vascular congestion. No definite pleural effusions or
 pneumothorax. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Worsening bibasilar opacities, which may be related to lower lung
 volumes or to increased pulmonary vascular congestion.
