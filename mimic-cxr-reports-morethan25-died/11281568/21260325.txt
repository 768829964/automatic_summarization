                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with respiratory distress  // Eval for pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, CT torso ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in unchanged position.  Cardiac, mediastinal and
 hilar contours appear similar.  Reduced lung volumes are re- demonstrated. 
 Diffuse interstitial opacities are compatible with a chronic interstitial lung
 disease, not substantially changed from prior.  Interval development of more
 focal patchy opacities in the lung bases compared to the recent radiograph may
 reflect superimposed infection or aspiration.  There may be superimposed mild
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. 
 Mildly distended air-filled loops of bowel are seen within the imaged upper
 abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval development of more focal bibasilar airspace opacities which may
 reflect infection or aspiration superimposed on a background of chronic
 interstitial lung disease.  There may be mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
