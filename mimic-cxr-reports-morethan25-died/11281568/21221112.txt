                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with history of ventilator-associated pneumonia
 and pulmonary edema.  Assess for interval change after diuresis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recent from
 ___. Chest CT from ___.  
 
 SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  An endotracheal tube is in
 standard position, 2 cm above the level of the carina.  There has been
 interval placement of a nasoenteric catheter with the tip incompletely imaged,
 though below the diaphragm.  Basilar predominant coarse reticular and
 ground-glass opacities are unchanged compared to most recent prior despite
 diuresis as well as bilateral ground glass opacities.  Given diffuse
 abnormalities seen on chest CT from 6 month prior, radiographic findings are
 likely chronic and related to either chronic PCP or ___ ___
 lung disease.  There is no evidence of pulmonary edema.    
 
 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged coarse reticular basilar-predominant opacities on
 background of diffuse ground glass opacification. This may represent chronic
 PCP or ___ diffuse fibrotic lung disease such as NSIP. No evidence of
 superimposed acute process.
