                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 7:31 P.M.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old quadriplegic after recent tracheostomy.  Now with
 pneumonia and recent Dobbhoff tube placement.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Opacification in the both lower lobes has worsened, now both are nearly
 uniformly opacified.  Although I cannot discount the possibility of pneumonia,
 the appearance is more suggestive of bilateral lower lobe collapse,
 accompanied by small bilateral pleural effusions.  Heart is moderately
 enlarged.  Pulmonary vascular engorgement is relatively mild.  A feeding tube
 ends in the mid stomach.  Inferior vena caval umbrella filter noted.  Left PIC
 line ends in the upper SVC.  No pneumothorax.
