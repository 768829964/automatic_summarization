                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent seizure activity, here to evaluate for pneumonia.  
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dated ___ and ___. 
 
 Technique:  PA and lateral radiographs of the chest.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Evaluation on the lateral radiograph is extremely limited due to patient
 positioning.  There is suboptimal positioning on the frontal view as well. 
 Within these limitations, this difficult to exclude a left basilar
 consolidation.  The right lung is relatively well aerated without pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax is detected.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged
 but stable.  The mediastinal contours are prominent in part related to poor
 patient positioning but likely within normal limits and unchanged.  A small
 left-sided pleural effusion is suspected.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Difficult to exclude a left basilar consolidation on this limited examination.
 Probable small left-sided pleural effusion.  Short-term follow-up radiographs
 may be helpful if clinically indicated.
