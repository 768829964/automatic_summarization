                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with seizure.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Lateral and AP
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 AP upright and lateral chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes.
 Allowing for this, radiograph appears similar when compared to prior study
 dated ___. There is opacification of the left lung base
 compatible with pleural effusion and atelectasis. The heart is enlarged with
 mild pulmonary congestion.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Left lower lobe pleural effusion and opacification thought likely sequela
 of atelectasis and/or aspiration, though early infectious process cannot
 entirely be excluded.
 2. Enlarged heart with mild congested pulmonary vessels.  No overt pulmonary
 edema.
