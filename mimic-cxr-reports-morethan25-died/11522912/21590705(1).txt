 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.  Evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A portable upright radiograph of the chest was obtained.  The exam
 is limited by motion.  The lung apices are obscured by overlying soft tissue. 
 The left costophrenic angle is obscured/blunted, secondary to underlying
 effusion or atelectasis versus overlying soft tissue.  A linear retrocardiac
 opacity is unchanged.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are similar in
 appearance to ___.
