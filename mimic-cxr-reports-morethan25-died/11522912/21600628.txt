                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with worsening hypoxia and secretions  // ?
 atelectasis / pneumonia
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable AP view radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs dating back to___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The moderate to large left pleural effusion has increased compared with ___, with left-sided atelectasis or collapse. Increased opacity in
 the left upper lobe is suspicious for pneumonia, though asymmetric edema is a
 possibility. New interstitial markings at the right base are compatible with
 increasing pulmonary vascular congestion and mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. New left upper lobe opacity is suspicious for pneumonia.
 2. Left pleural effusion has grown and is now moderate.
 3. Mild to moderate pulmonary edema.
