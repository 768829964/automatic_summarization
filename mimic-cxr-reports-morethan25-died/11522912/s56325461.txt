                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest radiograph
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated. The mediastinal and hilar contours
 are unchanged. There is mild upper zone vascular redistribution without overt
 pulmonary edema, a finding which appears chronic. Patchy opacities in the lung
 bases also persist, and likely reflect chronic bronchiectasis with atelectasis
 although aspiration is not excluded. No pneumothorax is identified though
 assessment is slightly limited due to the patient's neck and soft tissues of
 the chin projecting over these regions. No pleural effusion is identified. No
 acute osseous abnormality is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Chronic patchy bibasilar opacities, likely reflecting a combination of
 bronchiectasis and atelectasis, but aspiration is not completely excluded. 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with persistent upper zone vascular
 redistribution suggestive of elevated pulmonary venous pressures.
