                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubation.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is an endotracheal
 tube approximately 4 cm above the carina.  The nasogastric tube is no longer
 seen and there is substantial dilatation of the gas-filled stomach.  IVC
 filter is in place.
 
 Otherwise, little overall change in the appearance of the heart and lungs. 
 Poor definition of the left hemidiaphragm is again consistent with volume loss
 in the left lower lobe.
