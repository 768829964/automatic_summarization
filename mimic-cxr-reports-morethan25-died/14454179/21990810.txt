                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM, ___ AT 3:04 AM
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with left lung bleed, intubated, assess for
 interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study dated ___ at 13:08.
 
 A single portable supine chest film ___ at 3:04 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  There is persistent opacification of the left hemithorax with some
 residual aeration at the left lower lobe associated with volume loss and
 mediastinal and cardiac shift to the left.  Overall, the appearance does not
 appear to be significantly changed.  The endotracheal tube continues to have
 its tip 4 cm above the carina.  A right internal jugular central line has its
 tip in the distal SVC.  Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm
 with the tip within the stomach.  A portion of an inferior vena caval filter
 is also visualized at the edge of the film within the abdomen.  The right lung
 is well inflated without evidence of focal airspace consolidation, pulmonary
 edema, or pleural effusion.  There is a stable calcified nodule measuring 1.3
 cm in the seventh interspace.  This most likely represents a calcified
 granuloma.  No acute bony abnormality is appreciated.
