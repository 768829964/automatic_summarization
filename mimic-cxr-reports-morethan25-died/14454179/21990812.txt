 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Lupus, hemoptysis, intubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Volume loss in the left lung with subsequent mediastinal and cardiac
 shift.  Moderate atelectasis at the left lung base with evidence of a
 coexisting left pleural opacity.  The size of the cardiac silhouette cannot be
 determined.  The normal appearance of the right lung is unchanged.  Unchanged
 monitoring and support devices.
