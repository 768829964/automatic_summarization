 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Tachycardia, hemoptysis, assess for acute abnormality in
 the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is vague opacity in the left lung base which is stable from
 prior exam and likely represents scarring.  There are no convincing signs of
 pneumonia or CHF.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  The imaged bony structures are
