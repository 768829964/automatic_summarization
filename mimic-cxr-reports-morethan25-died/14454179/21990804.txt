                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hemoptysis, limited air movement.  Question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 Suspect background hyperinflation.  Superimposed on this, the heart is not
 enlarged.  The left hemidiaphragm is elevated.  
 
 There is patchy dense opacity at the left base, increased compared with
 ___.  Blunting of the left costophrenic angle suggests a small effusion. 
 Smudgy densities scattered in the right and ? left upper lung are compatible
 with ground glass oapcities seen on chest CTA obtained earlier the same day. 
 There is minimal biapical pleural scarring.  Note is made of calcification
 along the bronchial walls, an unusual finding in an individual of this age.
 
 A large (13 mm) coarse calcification overlying the right lung lies within the
 right breast.  
 
 Minimal superior endplate scalloping is noted in several mid/upper thoracic
 vertebral bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  I
 
 Irregular dense opacity at left base, increased compared with ___,
 associated with an elevated left hemidiaphragm.  Differential diagnosis
 includes alveolar processes such as infection and hemorrhage.
