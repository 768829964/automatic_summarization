                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.  Evaluation for
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There has been interval removal of the
 right central line and IVC filter.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with
 minimal subsegmental atelectasis persists though appears improved from prior. 
 No confluent opacity is identified to suggest pneumonia.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  A calcified granuloma in the right lower lobe appears similar
 to prior.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Improved aeration of the left lung base, with mild persistent
 atelectasis.  No evidence of acute pneumonia.
