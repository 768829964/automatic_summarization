 Right lower lobe collapse has improved.  Loss of volume of the right middle
 lobe is unchanged.  Right lower lobe atelectasis has markedly improved.  Lines
 and tubes remain in unchanged standard position.  There are no new lung
 abnormalities, pneumothorax, or enlarged pleural effusions.  Cardiomegaly is
 stable.
