 carina.  Right ventricular pacemaker/defibrillator courses in expected
 position.  Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach, and Dobbhoff tube tip
 is in the proximal duodenum.  There is no significant pneumothorax.  Lung
 volumes remain low, with increased left lower lobe atelectasis.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly, central venous congestion, and interstitial/airspace edema
 persist.  Aorta is tortuous and calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Increased left lower lobe atelectasis.
 2.  Moderate pulmonary edema.
