                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ERCP with abdominal distention and pain, to assess for free air.
 
 FINDINGS:  No evidence of free intraperitoneal gas, though this is probably
 not a true upright view.  In comparison with the earlier study of this date,
 there has been placement of a nasogastric tube that extends to the upper
 stomach, with the tip probably just above the esophagogastric junction.
 
 Continued low lung volumes.
