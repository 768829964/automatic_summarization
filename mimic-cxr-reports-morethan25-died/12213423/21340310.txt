                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Chest radiographs ___. CHEST
 (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p ex-lap and washout for bowel perforation, now
 with pneumonia  // Interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ through ___. Read in
 conjunction with chest CTA ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions have increased, obscuring the
 lower lungs. The appearance of the lower lungs on recent chest radiographs and
 mediastinum is quite wide a, CT scanning is more likely due to atelectasis
 than pneumonia.
 
 Substantial widening of the mediastinum has been variable, showing sensitivity
 of vascular caliber to intravascular volume and the patient positioning.
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is stable.
 
 ET tube, left internal jugular catheter are in standard placements.  Right
 internal jugular line ends above the origin of the SVC. Nasogastric tube
 passes below the diaphragm and out of view.
