                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxemia  // interval monitoring diffuse
 airspace disease      interval monitoring diffuse airspace disease
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Comparison to ___.  The known bilateral diffuse and predominantly
 interstitial opacities are not substantially changed in extent and severity. 
 The position of the monitoring and support devices, including the left pleural
 pigtail catheter, are constant.  No pleural effusions.  No evidence of
 pulmonary edema.
 
 As discussed this morning on location of a multidisciplinary conference, CT
 would be helpful to provide more detail about the known underlying and
 obviously progressive interstitial lung disease and to establish a new
 morphological baseline.
