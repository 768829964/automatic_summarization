                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright chest view was reviewed.  No prior chest
 radiographs are available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Bilateral lung volumes are low.  Single chest tube is present on
 the left side with its distal end terminating approximately at the level of
 the left second anterior rib.  Bilateral lower lung opacities are present
 which are likely lower lung atelectasis.  Small amount of subcutaneous air in
 the left lateral chest wall is attributed to the recent VATS. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent and probably exacerbated by the low
 lung volumes.  There is no demonstrable pneumothorax.
