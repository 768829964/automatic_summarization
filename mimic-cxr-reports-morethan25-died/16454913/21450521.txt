                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 10:27
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with renal transplant, status post trach,
 increasing secretions.  Please evaluate.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 12:44.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 10:27 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  A feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm, although there is a
 loop above the diaphragm which could represent a coiling within a small hiatal
 hernia.  The tip, however, does pass below the diaphragm and is not visualized
 on the current study.  The tracheostomy tube remains in place.  There are
 bilateral layering effusions which have increased on the right when compared
 to the prior study.  There is perihilar and bilateral airspace interstitial
 process, this is slightly worsened since the prior study, which suggests that
 there is at least an element of superimposed pulmonary edema, although diffuse
 pneumonia or underlying interstitial lung disease cannot be excluded. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  The heart remains enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are difficult to assess due to patient rotation.  A right fourth
 posterolateral thoracotomy is seen.  No pneumothorax.
