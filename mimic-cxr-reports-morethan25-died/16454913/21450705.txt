                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Extensive past medical history, patient in ICU with
 osteomyelitis of the sacrum with respiratory complaints and new right upper
 lobe opacity, assess layering effusion or pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph obtained.  Patient has a
 tracheostomy tube which appears grossly unchanged.  NG tube courses into the
 left upper abdomen.  A right arm PICC line is seen, tip extending into the
 lower SVC/right atrium.  As seen previously, there is extensive opacity in the
 right lung concerning for pneumonia, though a component of loculated effusion
 is also suggested.  There is likely superimposed pulmonary edema.  No large
 left effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 difficult to assess.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent opacity involving the right lung is concerning for
 pneumonia with superimposed pulmonary edema.  Right pleural effusion appears
 loculated.
