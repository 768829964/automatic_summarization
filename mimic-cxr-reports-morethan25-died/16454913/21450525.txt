                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient with multiple medical problems and pulmonary edema
 and followup.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Tracheostomy is in standard position.  Feeding tube is out of view below the
 diaphragm.  Small bilateral pleural effusions have probably increased on the
 left.  Bibasilar opacities are a combination of atelectasis and pleural
 effusion, larger on the right side, superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
 Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is stable.  Cardiac size cannot be evaluated,
 is obscured by pleural parenchyma abnormalities.  Widened mediastinum is
 stable.
