                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post bowel resection, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 slightly decreased.  The tracheostomy tube and the left internal jugular vein
 catheter are constant in appearance.  Unchanged left pleural effusion with
 retrocardiac atelectasis, moderately increased cardiac silhouette and the
 presence of moderate pulmonary edema.  The small right pleural effusion
 appears to have newly developed.
 
 No pneumothorax.  No new parenchymal opacity that would suggest pneumonia.
