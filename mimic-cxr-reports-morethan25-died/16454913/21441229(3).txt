                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Tracheobronchomalacia, status post tracheobronchoplasty,
 evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 3:44 a.m.
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the
 nasogastric tube has been removed.  The right chest tube remains in situ.  The
 patient has received a tracheostomy tube.  The tip of the tracheostomy tube is
 in expected position.  Overall, the lung volumes have decreased, leading to
 increase of the pre-existing areas of atelectasis at both the left and the
 right lung base.  Also, there is unchanged blunting of the left
 costodiaphragmatic recess, suggesting the presence of a small left pleural
 effusion.  
 
 Unchanged moderate cardiomegaly with minimal fluid overload.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.
