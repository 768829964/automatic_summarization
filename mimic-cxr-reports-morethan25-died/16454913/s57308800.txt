                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intermittent hypotension with volume overload.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the tracheostomy tube remains
 in place.  There is continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, which
 appears less prominent because of the PA view.  Bilateral pleural effusions
 are again seen, with compressive atelectasis at the bases.  There appears to
 be some fullness of pulmonary vessels consistent with elevated pulmonary
 venous pressure.  An area of oblique opacification at the right base could
 represent a region of atelectasis.  The appearance would be somewhat unusual
 for superimposed pneumonia.
