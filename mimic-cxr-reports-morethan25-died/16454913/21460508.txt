                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of left internal jugular vascular catheter terminates in the
 proximal left brachiocephalic vein without change.  Markedly widened
 cardiomediastinal contours appear to be due to a combination of vascular
 distension and mediastinal lipomatosis as evidenced on prior CT of the chest
 of ___.  Worsening pulmonary vascular congestion accompanied by
 moderately severe pulmonary edema and an enlarging left pleural effusion,
 occupying approximately half the volume of the left hemithorax.  Small right
 pleural effusion has also slightly worsened.  Bilateral retrocardiac opacities
 are unchanged and probably correspond to a combination of pleural fluid and
 atelectasis, although underlying infectious consolidation is also possible in
 the appropriate clinical setting.
