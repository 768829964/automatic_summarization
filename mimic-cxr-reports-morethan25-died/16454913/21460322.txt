                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with tracheostomy reentering for line associated
 sepsis, now with fever and hypotension.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT abdomen and pelvis on ___ and multiple prior chest
 radiographs, most recent on ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Venous catheter still ends in the right axilla. Right lower lobe is
 probably collapsed.  Previous pulmonary vascular congestion has resolved and
 small bilateral pleural effusions, more pronounced in the left, have improved
 from ___.  Heart normal size. Chronic widening of the upper
 mediastinum is probably due to fat deposition. There is no pneumothorax.  The
 tracheostomy cannula looks small relative to tracheal caliber.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe collapse.  No pneumonia. Suggest clinical
 evaluation of tracheostomy tube sizing. Small, diminishing, bilateral pleural
 effusion.
