                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FILM ___ AT 5:28
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with complicated history of sepsis and
 ischemic bowel status post exploratory laparotomy, question interval change.
 
 Comparison is made to patient's prior study of ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 5:28 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Tracheostomy remains in place.  A face mask obscures the lung apices.  A
 left internal jugular central line is unchanged in position likely within the
 brachiocephalic vein.  The heart remains enlarged.  There is a layering left
 effusion and likely a smaller right effusion.  There is increasing prominence
 of the perihilar vasculature and indistinctness of the more peripheral
 vasculature, which may reflect mild pulmonary interstitial edema.  Clinical
 correlation is advised.  Retrocardiac opacity likely reflects atelectasis in
 the setting of effusion, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  No
 large pneumothorax is appreciated.
