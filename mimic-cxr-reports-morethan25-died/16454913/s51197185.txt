                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-___ ___ ___  
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of pneumothorax following right-sided vascular
 catheter attempt.  Right PICC remains in a proximal location, with tip
 terminating in the right axillary region.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 stable in appearance.  Mild pulmonary vascular congestion is present.  New
 left perihilar haziness could reflect asymmetrical edema or other process such
 as aspiration or developing pneumonia.  Left retrocardiac atelectasis has
 partially cleared and a right basilar atelectasis is also slightly improved. 
 Small right and moderate left pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
