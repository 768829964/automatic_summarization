 Comparison to prior study dated ___.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 4:44 a.m. is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left internal jugular central line and tracheostomy tube remain unchanged.
 The heart is enlarged.  Mediastinal contour appear widened but likely is
 related to patient rotation.  There continues to be a layering left effusion
