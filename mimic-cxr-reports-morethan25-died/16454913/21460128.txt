 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Sepsis, concern for free air, assess for signs of
 intraperitoneal air.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright chest radiograph was provided.  Tracheostomy
 tube is present.  There is a right arm PICC line with its tip seen at the
 level of the right axilla.  Bilateral pleural effusions are seen, left greater
 than right with left basal consolidation again noted.  There is no evidence of
 pneumoperitoneum.  The heart is difficult to assess.  The mediastinal contour
 appears grossly stable.  Bony structures are intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No convincing signs of intraperitoneal free air.  Stable
 bilateral effusions with left lower lobe consolidation.
