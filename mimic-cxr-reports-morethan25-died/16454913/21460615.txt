                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Sepsis, now with decreased breath sounds on the left.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single, AP, portable view of the chest with the patient in a
 semi-erect position.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to radiographs dated ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Seen again is complete collapse of the left lower lobe.  As compared to prior
 examination, the expanded lungs are now somewhat better aerated.  The right
 lung continues to demonstrate mild pulmonary edema with an associated pleural
 effusion.  A small left effusion is stable.  The heart size appears to be
 slightly enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  Two left subclavian
 catheters are unchanged in position, terminating within the mid SVC.  There is
 no associated pneumothorax.
