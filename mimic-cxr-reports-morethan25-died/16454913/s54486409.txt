 The right upper lobe opacity is now larger since yesterday and highly
 suspicious for pneumonia.  The right lower lobe has improved, for reduced
 vascular congestion.  The opacification of the left lung has markedly
 increased, for increased pleural effusion.  Heart size is persistently
 enlarged, but not fully assessable for left pleural effusion.  There is no
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased right upper lobe opacity with marked increase of left
 pleural effusion.  Minimal improvement of the right base ventilation mainly
 for reduced vascular congestion. Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ at 3.___
