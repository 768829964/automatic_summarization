                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man status post EGD and bronchoscopy with therapeutic
 aspiration of secretions.  Question atelectasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, most recently from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect AP portable view is provided.  Again there are
 bibasilar consolidations and pleural effusions with mild pulmonary edema, but
 improved opacities particularly in the right lower lobe. The opacities in the
 left midlung are new. These findings are consistent with with redistribution
 of edema, although the new opacity in the left midlung could represent a focal
 infectious process versus fluid in the fissure.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 and hilar contours are stable.  A left-sided internal jugular line terminates
 in the right atrium unchanged from prior studies.
 
 Above the tracheotomy, there is narrowing of the airway which could be due to
 diffuse edema of larynx.
