                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Tracheobronchomalacia, and clinical signs of right lower
 lung pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP upright portable chest radiograph obtained.  Dialysis catheter
 is in unchanged position.  There is slight increased consolidation at the
 right lung base, which could reflect effusion and/or consolidation/pneumonia. 
 There is stable appearance at the left lung base.  No pneumothorax. 
 Evaluation for mild fluid overload is limited, though likely present.  Bony
 structures are intact.  Heart and mediastinal contours overall unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing opacity at the right lung base which may represent a
 combination of effusion and pneumonia.
