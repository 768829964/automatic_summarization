                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Patient on hemodialysis and intubated.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 Large bilateral pleural effusions, larger on the right side, are probably
 unchanged allowing the difference in positioning of the patient.  Bibasilar
 atelectases, larger on the left side, are stable.  Cardiomegaly is obscured by
 the pleuroparenchymal abnormalities.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged
 standard position.  Mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema is stable.
