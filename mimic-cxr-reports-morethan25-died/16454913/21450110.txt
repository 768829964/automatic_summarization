                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for intrapulmonary process in patient with multiple
 organ transplantation, status post tracheobronchoplasty complicated by airway
 occlusion and emergent surgical airway and open tracheostomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Most recent chest radiograph from ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright portable AP radiograph of the chest:  The right
 internal jugular central venous catheter is unchanged in position.  The
 tracheostomy tube is situated appropriately 5 cm above the carina.  Compared
 to the prior study from 24 hours ago, there is increased pulmonary vascular
 markings as well as enlargement of the bilateral pleural effusions, consistent
 with volume overload.  There is no pneumothorax.  Low lung volumes and
 bibasilar atelectasis unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Interval increase in interstitial pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural
 effusions, consistent with volume overload.
