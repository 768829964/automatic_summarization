                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Left pigtail pleural catheter remains in place, with no evidence of
 pneumothorax, and an unchanged small left pleural effusion.  Cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable.  Slight improvement in heterogeneous opacities in the
 right lung, which could reflect asymmetrical edema or infection in the
 appropriate clinical setting.  Within the left lung, streaky left retrocardiac
 opacities have slightly improved, and there are no new or worsening lung
 abnormalities.  Small right-sided pleural effusion is unchanged.
