                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of stroke, status post tracheostomy, now with increased
 respiratory distress and confusion, here to evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  An orogastric
 feeding tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm and out of view on this
 image.  Small bilateral pleural effusions appear unchanged on the right and
 slightly decreased on the left compared to the prior study of ___. 
 Bibasilar opacities appear stable and likely reflect a combination of
 atelectasis and pleural effusion, greater on the right than the left.  In the
 appropriate clinical context, superimposed infection cannot be excluded. 
 Pulmonary vascular congestion and asymmetric interstitial pulmonary edema
 greater on the right than the left is similar to the prior study.  The cardiac
 silhouette is incompletely evaluated due to obscuration by pleural parenchymal
 abnormalities.  The prominent mediastinum is unchanged in contour from
 ___. Inferior subluxation of the right humeral head is incidentally
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 Improved aeration of left lung base. Otherwise, similar appearance of chest
 ___ ___.
