                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Multiple line attempts, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there have apparently been
 several attempts at central line placement.  No evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 left IJ catheter seen previously has been removed.
 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in place.  Increased opacification at the left base
 is consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe and pleural fluid.  Little
 change in the moderate pulmonary edema.
