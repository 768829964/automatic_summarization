                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FROM ___ AT 12:44
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with tracheomalacia status post multiple
 procedures with intermittent dyspnea, evaluate for interval changes.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 10:57.
 
 A portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 12:44 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Feeding tube remains in place with the tip not visualized but at least
 coursing below the level of the diaphragm.  A tracheostomy tube remains in
 satisfactory position.  There is a diffuse bilateral airspace and interstitial
 process with more patchy opacities at both bases.  Overall, this is likely not
 significantly changed but could reflect pulmonary edema, diffuse pneumonia, or
 underlying interstitial lung disease.  Clinical correlation is advised.  Heart
 remains enlarged.  There is likely a left pleural effusion, possibly a smaller
 right effusion.  There is a right fourth posterior lateral thoracotomy.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
