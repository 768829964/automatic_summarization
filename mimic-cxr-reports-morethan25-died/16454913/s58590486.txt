                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  History of failed kidney and pancreas transplant with
 mesenteric ischemia and septic shock.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There are low lung volumes.  Of note, the right lower hemithorax was not
 included on the film.  Allowing this limitation, there appears to be slight
 improvement in the aeration of the left lower lobe.  Bilateral effusions
 larger on the right side are probably unchanged.  Cardiomegaly cannot be
 assessed.  Left subclavian catheter tip is in the low SVC.  Tracheostomy tube
 is in a standard position.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema has minimally improved.
