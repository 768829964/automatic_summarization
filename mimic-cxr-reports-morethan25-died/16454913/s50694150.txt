                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 8:25 P.M. ON ___  
 
 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old man after tracheobronchoplasty for malacia.  Hypoxic
 and tachypneic, on a ventilator via a tracheostomy tube.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Tracheostomy tube has a relatively short intratracheal excursion and should be
 evaluated clinically to see if it is properly positioned.  Mild-to-moderate
 pulmonary edema has improved and small-to-moderate bilateral pleural
 effusions, stable on the right and decreased on the left.  Heart is moderately
 to severely enlarged though improved, as is mediastinal vascular engorgement. 
 Left lower lobe is airless, presumably atelectasis.  A feeding tube or
 catheter probe ends in the region of the pylorus.  No pneumothorax.
