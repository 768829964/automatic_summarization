                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube remains in place.  Diffuse cardiomediastinal
 widening appears similar to the prior study, and appears to be predominantly
 due mediastinal lipomatosis as well as distended vascular structures based on
 prior CT of ___.  Pulmonary vascular congestion is accompanied by
 mild-to-moderate pulmonary edema.  Bilateral lower lobe retrocardiac opacities
 have worsened, and may reflect atelectasis with or without coexisting
 infection.  Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are present, similar on the
 left, but worse on the right.  Right PICC continues to terminate in the right
 axilla.
