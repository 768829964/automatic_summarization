                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH 
 
 INDICATION:  Worsening hypoxemia, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  The ventilation at the lung bases has improved, the
 pre-existing parenchymal opacities have decreased in extent and severity.  The
 size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  The presence of a small left
 pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
