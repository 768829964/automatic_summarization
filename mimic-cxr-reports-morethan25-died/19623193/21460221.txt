 WET READ: ___ ___ 11:29 PM
  Increased bilateral lower lobe consolidation, R>L, c/w worsening pneumonia.
  Given TBB history, components of aspiration + hemorrhage also possible.  Small
  effusions.  Emphysema.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Status post bronchoscopy, evaluation for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, at 2:09.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a minimal increase
 in severity of the bilateral lower lobe consolidations.  This could represent
 worsening pneumonia, complicated by pulmonary edema.  The presence of small
 bilateral pleural effusions cannot be excluded.  Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged monitoring and support devices.
