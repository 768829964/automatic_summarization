                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate endotracheal tube in patient status post intubation for
 respiratory failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs from ___ back to
 ___.  CT abdomen and pelvis from ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT RADIOGRAPH OF THE CHEST:  The endotracheal tube terminates
 approximately 4 cm above the carina.  Additionally, there is a left PICC and
 nasogastric tube in unchanged position.  Compared to the prior radiographs
 taken on the same day ___ at 02:34, there is worsening of the
 bilateral lower lobe heterogeneous opacities with airspace features.  The
 upper lung fields are otherwise clear.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are
 bilateral small pleural effusions, not markedly changed from the previous
 radiograph.  The sternal cerclage wires and aortic calcification is unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube in appropriate position.
 2.  Worsening bilateral lower lobe pneumonia, concerning for evolving
