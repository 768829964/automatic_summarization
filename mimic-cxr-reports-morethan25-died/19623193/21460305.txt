                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable, single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient initially admitted with constipation,
 now Aspergillus pneumonia and VRE bacteremia, on CPAP.  Evaluate for pulmonary
 edema.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest was obtained with patient in sitting
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  There is status post sternotomy, apparently
 related to previous bypass surgery.  Moderate cardiac enlargement is noted. 
 The pulmonary vasculature demonstrates an upper zone redistribution pattern
 and diffuse haze over the bases is consistent with interstitial edema.  The
 previously described superimposed patchy and partially confluenting
 parenchymal infiltrates have regressed slightly, but persist to some degree
 bilaterally.  The right-sided diaphragm can now be identified again, so that
 major pleural effusion is unlikely.  If evaluation of pleural effusion is
 essential, one should consider the performance of a lateral view as well.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild improvement of previously identified scattered parenchymal
 infiltrates superimposed on chronic CHF.
