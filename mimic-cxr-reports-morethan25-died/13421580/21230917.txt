 AP CHEST, 3:43 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis and pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Large bilateral pleural effusions have increased, generally obscuring most of
 both lungs, where it is possible, particularly on the left, there is a large
 pneumonia.  If pleural effusions are not to be drained, I would recommend CT
 scanning to examine the lungs.
