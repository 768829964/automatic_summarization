                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient intubated with interval
 progression of parenchymal opacities.  
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4.8 cm above the carina.  The Dobbhoff tube passes below
 the diaphragm terminating in the stomach.  The left PICC line tip terminates
 at the level of SVC.  Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of
 cavoatrial junction.  The left retrocardiac consolidation is unchanged and
 most likely represents atelectasis and pleural effusion combination. 
 Widespread parenchymal opacities involving the entire chest unchanged as well
 with no new consolidations currently seen.
