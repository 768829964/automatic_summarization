                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, respiratory distress, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is a slight increase
 in lung volumes, likely reflecting increased ventilatory pressures.  The
 pre-existing parenchymal opacities are slightly less severe than on the
 previous image, but still relatively advanced and diffuse.  Unchanged presence
 of a left pleural effusion is likely.  No pneumothorax.
