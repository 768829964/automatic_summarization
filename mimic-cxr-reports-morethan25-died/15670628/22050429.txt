                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p anterior cervical corpectomy C4-C6 with C3-C6 fusion for
 non-traumatic C4-C6 anterior cervical epidural hematoma, intraventricular
 hemorrhage within the atria of right lateral ventricle, in setting of
 anticoagulation use for mechanical valves.  // ?interval change   ?interval

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are stable.  Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits.  The
 pulmonary vessels are less well defined, consistent with some elevation in
 pulmonary venous pressure.  The right hemidiaphragm is now sharply seen,
 though there is obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm with hazy opacification
 at the base, consistent with pleural fluid and volume loss in the left lower
 lung.
