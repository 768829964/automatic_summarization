                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p anterior cervical corpectomy C4-C6 with C3-C6 fusion for
 non-traumatic C4-C6 anterior cervical epidural hematoma, intraventricular
 hemorrhage within the atria of right lateralventricle, in setting of
 anticoagulation use for mechanical valves.  // ?interval change   ?interval

 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices are essentially unchanged.  Continued low lung volumes accentuate the
 size of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  Left basilar opacification is
 consistent with pleural fluid and atelectatic changes.  Mild indistinctness of
 pulmonary vessels again suggest some mild elevation of pulmonary venous
 pressure.
