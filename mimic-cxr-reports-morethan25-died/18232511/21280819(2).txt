                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post PSF.  Evaluate after extubation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  CT chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A right middle and lower lung consolidation has worsened since
 prior exams, specifically in the periphery of the right mid lung zone.  Small
 right and left pleural effusions are unchanged.  Hazy opacification at the
 left base is likely atelectasis, although an underlying infectious process
 cannot be excluded.  A left chest tube is unchanged.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.  A left central
 venous catheter ends in the upper SVC.  Spinal hardware is unchanged in
 appearance.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Significantly worse right mid and lower lung opacification is likely an
 infectious process.
 2.  Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
 3.  Probable left basal atelectasis, although infectious process cannot be
 excluded.
