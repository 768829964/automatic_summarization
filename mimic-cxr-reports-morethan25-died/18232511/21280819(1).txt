 AP CHEST, 12:48 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with respiratory distress and secretions.  Check ET
 tube placement and possible pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 ET tube in standard placement at the thoracic inlet.  A paramedian left chest
 tube in standard placement.  No left pneumothorax.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions have decreased since earlier in the day and a previous large region
 of atelectasis in the right lung has cleared.  Heart is mildly enlarged.  A
 large bore left internal jugular catheter projects over the aortic knob,
