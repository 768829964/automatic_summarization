                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 5:33 A.M. ON ___:
 
 HISTORY:  Spinal fusion.  Evaluate interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Bibasilar consolidation could represent atelectasis or pneumonia, particularly
 aspiration.  Upper lungs show persistent chronic pulmonary vascular congestion
 and only mild pulmonary edema.  Severe cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular
 engorgement are less pronounced today than it was over the past week.  No
 pneumothorax.  Nasogastric tube can be traced only as far as the mid esophagus
 where its course is obscured by spinal hardware, not fully evaluated by this
 study.  No pneumothorax.
