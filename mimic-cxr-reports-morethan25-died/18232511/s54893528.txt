                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with bibasilar opacities on prior AP chest
 radiograph.  PA and lateral examination for further characterization.
 
 COMPARISON:  Frontal chest radiograph from ___ at 8:34 a.m.
 
 AP AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  Lateral examination is extremely limited
 due to the arm down positioning.  Persistent basilar opacities may be seen
 with atelectasis although the etiology is not specific.  A new mild
 interstitial abnormality suggests mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The
 upper lungs remain clear.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within
 normal limits.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Persistent basilar opacities which are not specific; these could be seen
 with atelectasis, although other etiologies such as pneumonia and aspiration
 are not entirely excluded.
 
 2.  Findings suggesting mild new vascular congestion.
 
 3.  Convex right mid mediastinal contour; evaluation with chest CT is
 recommended when clinically appropriate.
 
 Final report discussed with Dr. ___ at 9:15 pm by telephone.
