                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT CHEST FILM ___ AT 554 
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old, assess for fluid overload.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's prior study of ___ at 535.
 
 Single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 554 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Endotracheal tube, nasogastric tube, left internal jugular introducer
 catheter unchanged in position.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 likely stable given differences in positioning.  Spinal hardware overlies mid
 to lower thoracic spine.  
 
 2.  Bilateral layering effusions with persistent retrocardiac opacity and
 fluctuating somewhat improved right basilar opacity.  These likely reflect
 layering effusions with associated compressive atelectasis, although bibasilar
 pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  There is fullness of the hilar vessels
 but no overt pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax is appreciated.
