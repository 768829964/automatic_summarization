  ETT in standard position approx 6 cm above the carina. Esophageal catheter tip
  in distal esophagus and should be advanced 9-10 cm to ensure tip and sideport
  both within stomach. R-PICC in SVC. lungs appear similar with some improvement
  in atelectasis on the left.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess ET tube and NG tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 10 hours earlier.
 
 ET tube tip is in a standard position 6 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip is
 in the distal esophagus, should be advanced at least 10 cm for more standard
 position.  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged with tortuous aorta,
 enlarged pulmonary arteries, and cardiomegaly.  Right PICC tip is in the mid
 SVC.  Bilateral pleural effusions are small.  Bibasilar atelectasis has
 improved on the right and worsened on the left.  There is mild vascular
 congestion.  There is no pneumothorax.  Hardware in the thoracic spine is
 again noted.
