                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 5:34 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Epidural hematoma.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Patient is rotated severely to the right, enlarging the apparent diameter of
 the cardiomediastinal silhouette, and obscuring what is now a densely
 consolidated right lower lobe.  It also reveals severely consolidated left
 lower lobe.  At best, these are areas of lobar collapse, but pneumonia may
 well be present, particularly on the right.  Left pleural tube in place. 
 Skinfold should not be mistaken for pneumothorax; there is none.  There is
 likely small-to-moderate bilateral pleural effusion.  ET tube is in standard
 placement.  Left jugular catheter ends at the origin of the left
 brachiocephalic vein as before.  Nasogastric tube probably ends in the distal
 esophagus, although on ___ it clearly ended in the gastric fundus.  For
 that reason, I would strongly recommend repeat chest radiographs carefully
 positioned, collimated to the ___ the chest to improve imaging of the
 nasogastric tube and a more reliable depiction of both the mediastinum and
 both lower lobes.
