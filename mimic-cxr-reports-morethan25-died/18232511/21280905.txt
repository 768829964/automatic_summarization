                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST 7:44 A.M. ___  
 
 HISTORY:  Evaluate cardiopulmonary process.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Since ___, following extubation, lung volumes have decreased and
 greater opacification at the lung bases, particularly the right indicates
 worsening atelectasis.  Left lower lobe atelectasis was severe prior to
 extubation, unchanged, though there is an increase in small left pleural
 effusion.  Severe cardiomegaly is chronic.  Pulmonary vascular congestion has
 worsened in the lung apices, but I don't see pulmonary edema.  Right PIC line
 ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.
