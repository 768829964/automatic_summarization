                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Possible right aspiration pneumonia.  Evaluate for change.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph, ___ at 3:54 a.m.  Chest
 radiograph, ___.  Chest CT, ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A left internal jugular central venous catheter ends in the upper
 SVC.  The left chest tube is unchanged in appearance.  Spinal hardware is
 stable.  Since the prior radiograph, the previously seen mid right lung
 peripheral opacification has improved, suggesting that it was likely
 aspiration.  A large right central mid and lower lung opacity persists and
 looks similar to multiple prior radiographs.  A moderate right pleural
 effusion and a small left pleural effusion are unchanged.  Hazy opacification
 at the left base is likely atelectasis, although an underlying infection
 cannot be excluded.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Resolution of peripheral right mid lung zone opacification suggests it was
 likely due to aspiration.
 2.  Persistent central right mid and lower lung opacification could represent
 an underlying infectious process.  
 3.  Stable moderate right and small left pleural effusions.  
 4.  Left hazy opacification is likely atelectasis, although an underlying
 infectious process cannot be excluded.
