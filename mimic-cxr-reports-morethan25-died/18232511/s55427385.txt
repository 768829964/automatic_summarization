                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man status post removal of chest tube.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  This study is technically limited secondary to portable format, low
 lung volumes, multiple overlying lines and metallic hardware.  However, within
 the limitations of the study, a small lucency which may represent a
 pneumothorax with a maximal width of 5 mm is seen in the apical left
 hemithorax.  Consolidation in the right middle lobe is unchanged.  There has
 been interval removal of the left-sided chest tube.  NG and endotracheal tubes
 are seen in unchanged position.  Paravertebral metallic rods are seen again
 with no obvious hardware complications.  There is stable cardiomegaly. 
 Mediastinal vasculature is unchanged.  There are no obvious signs of pulmonary
 edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval removal of left-sided chest tube.  Small left
 pneumothorax cannot be excluded.
