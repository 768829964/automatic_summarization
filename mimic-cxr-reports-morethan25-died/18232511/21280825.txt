                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Intubated patient.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 Cardiomegaly, enlarged pulmonary arteries and tortuous aorta are unchanged. 
 Right lower lobe aeration is improved.  There has been bibasilar opacities
 consistent with a combination of pleural effusions and atelectasis.  Vascular
 congestion has improved.  There is no pneumothorax.  There are no new lung
 abnormalities.  Lines and tubes are in unchanged positions.  Spinal hardware
 is again noted.
