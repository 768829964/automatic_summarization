                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess NG tube.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed a day earlier.
 
 NG tube tip is in the right lower lung.  The tube has been repositioned in a
 followup study performed 30 minutes after this was taken.  Cardiomegaly and
 widened mediastinum are stable.  Bibasilar opacities have improved on the
 right; these can represent atelectases or aspiration pneumonia.  Mild
 pulmonary edema is unchanged.  Presumed bilateral pleural effusions are
 stable.  Spinal hardware is again noted.
