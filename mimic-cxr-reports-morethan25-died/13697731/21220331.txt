                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with new tracheostomy, assess for
 pneumothorax and tracheostomy placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study obtained 12 hours earlier during the same day. 
 During the interval, the patient has been extubated and a tracheostomy was
 performed.  The tracheal cannula is in place, seen to terminate in the trachea
 some 6 cm above the carina.  No pneumothorax has developed.  Previously
 described central venous line is in unchanged position.  NG tube has been
 removed. Cardiac enlargement as before and the rather massive pleural
 effusions persist.  No evidence of new infiltrates.
