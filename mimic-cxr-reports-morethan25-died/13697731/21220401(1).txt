                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH:
 
 INDICATION:  Fluid overload, questionable interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Moderate cardiomegaly with bilateral pleural effusions, right more
 than left, and subsequent atelectasis at the right lung bases.  The monitoring
 and support devices are constant.  No new parenchymal opacity suggesting
 pneumonia.  No other lung abnormalities.  There is no convincing evidence for
 a left pneumothorax on the current image.
