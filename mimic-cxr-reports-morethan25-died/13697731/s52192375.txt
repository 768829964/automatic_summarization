                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pentobarbital coma, evaluate for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiographs of the chest dated ___ at 8:21 p.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP portable semi-erect radiograph of the chest.  There are moderate
 right and small left-sided pleural effusions which are apparently mildly
 increased compared to the prior radiograph. However, this apparent change
 could be potentially due to differences in patient positioning. The
 tracheostomy, enteric tube, and right subclavian catheter are unchanged in
 position.
