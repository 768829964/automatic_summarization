 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is an increase in
 extent of the pre-existing right pleural effusion.  On the left, a moderate
 pleural effusion has newly occurred.  The subsequent areas of atelectasis at
 both lung bases are substantial.  In the well-ventilated lung parenchyma,
