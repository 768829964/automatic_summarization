 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate central pulmonary vascular congestion is associated with moderate to
 severe interstitial pulmonary edema, predominantly in the bilateral lung
 bases.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are likely.  There is no
 pneumothorax or definite focal consolidation.  The cardiomediastinal contour,
 including mild cardiomegaly, is unchanged.  The osseous structures and upper
 abdomen are unremarkable.
