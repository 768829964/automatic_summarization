                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single erect portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  CHF, shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single erect AP portable view of the chest was obtained.  The left
 hemidiaphragm remains elevated.  There is blunting of the left costophrenic
 angle, which could be due to a small pleural effusion.  Left retrocardiac
 opacity is seen, which may be due to underpenetration, although underlying
 consolidation and/or pleural effusion, atelectasis not excluded.  There is
 prominence of the central vasculature and the interstitium suggesting
 pulmonary edema.  The cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.
