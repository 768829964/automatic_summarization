                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with dyspnea, hypoxia, aortic stenosis
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable supine AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 05:18
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is re- demonstrated. The
 mediastinal contour is unchanged with atherosclerotic calcifications noted at
 the aortic knob.  Moderate to severe pulmonary edema appears minimally worse
 compared to the previous study with continued small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  More focal opacities at the lung bases may reflect areas of
 atelectasis.  No pneumothorax is present.  There are no acute osseous
 abnormalities.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slight interval worsening of moderate to severe pulmonary edema and continued
 small bilateral pleural effusions.
