                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with bradycardia, shortness of breath, weakness
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is unchanged.  The aorta remains tortuous and
 diffusely calcified.  Mild pulmonary edema appears slightly worse in the
 interval with perihilar haziness and vascular indistinctness.  Patchy
 bibasilar opacities may reflect areas of atelectasis.  There are likely trace
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Elevation of the left hemidiaphragm is
 unchanged.  No pneumothorax is present.  Multilevel degenerative changes are
 noted in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, slightly worse in the interval with probable trace
 bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis.
