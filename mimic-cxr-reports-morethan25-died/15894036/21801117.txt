                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with CHF  // tube placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 06:37
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The endotracheal tube is been pulled back and is now 6 cm above the carina.
 the right IJ line is unchanged.  This is a rotated film and therefore it is
 difficult to assess for the degree of right lower lobe volume loss.  A 4 cm
 rounded opacity is seen projecting to the right of the spine. It is unclear
 where this originates from. Is not been visualized on prior studies however we
 have not had a prior exam in this rotation. A CT scan would be needed for
 further assessment.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Improved location of the ET tube
 2.  4 cm mass projecting to the right of the spine. Recommend CT
 
 NOTIFICATION:  Findings were discussed with ___ in the ICU at the time of
 discovery by Dr. ___ on ___ at 10:45
