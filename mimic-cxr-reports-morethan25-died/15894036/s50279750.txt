                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with hypoxia  // ? lung fields / infiltrae
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been extubated and the
 nasogastric tube was removed.  The tip of the right internal jugular vein
 catheter currently projects over the upper parts of the right atrium.  As
 expected, the lung volumes have decreased and signs of mild fluid overload are
 seen. However, there is no evidence of overt pulmonary edema.  No pleural
 effusions.  No pneumonia. Moderate cardiomegaly.
