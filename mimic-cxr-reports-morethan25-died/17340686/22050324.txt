                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FRONTAL AND LATERAL CHEST RADIOGRAPHS:  A large caliber left approach central
 venous catheter terminates in the right atrium, unchanged from prior.  There
 is new opacification of the retrocardiac space which could reflect pneumonia
 or aspiration in the appropriate clinical circumstance.  Atelectasis is also
 within the differential.  Mild diffuse interstitial abnormality is unchanged
 compared to multiple prior radiographs.  There is no large pleural effusion. 
 No pneumothorax is evident.  There is evidence of stable pulmonary
 hypertension and vascular engorgement, unchanged from prior.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly is unchanged.  Deformity of proximal right humerus appears
 chronic.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New retrocardiac opacity which could reflect aspiration, infection or
 atelectasis.
 2.  Unchanged background interstitial abnormality and central vascular
 enlargement.
