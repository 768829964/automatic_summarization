                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Syncope.  Rule out pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recently of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Mild cardiomegaly is similar to prior.  Cardiomediastinal contours
 are stable. Indistinct appearance of the pulmonary vasculature is compatible
 with pulmonary edema.  Nodular opacity projecting over the right mid lung is
 similar to ___.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle and
 indistinctness of the left costophrenic angle are compatible with small
 bilateral pleural effusions.  Retrocardiac opacity may represent atelectasis
 though pneumonia is not excluded.  No pneumothorax.  Dialysis catheter
 terminates in the right atrium.  The right humeral head is chronically
 deformed and an adjacent calcified loose body is again seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Mild pulmonary edema, similar to ___, with small
 bilateral pleural effusion and retrocardiac opacity compatible with
 atelectasis, although pneumonia may be considered in the appropriate clinical
 setting.
