                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of multiple medical problems with cough and possible
 pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest
 ___ ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An opacity in the right infrahilar region on the PA image and
 overlying the spine on the lateral image is consistent with pneumonia.  The
 previously seen opacity on the left has improved suggesting it was likely due
 to edema.  A pulmonary edema is improved from the prior radiograph, although a
 small amount of edema remains.  The cardiac silhouette is stably enlarged. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  A right internal jugular
 double-lumen hemodialysis catheter ends in the atrium.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1.  Right infrahilar opacity is most likely pneumonia.
 2.  Improving pulmonary edema.
