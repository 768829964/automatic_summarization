                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with shoulder dislocation, preoperative
 evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A portable AP upright view of the chest was obtained.  Again seen
 is a right-sided dialysis catheter terminating in the right atrium.  Heart is
 mildly enlarged.  Pulmonary vasculature is mildly engorged. A rounded opacity
 at the right base, present sicne ___, may represent asymmetric pulmonary
 edema, but other processes such as pulmonary abscess cannot be excluded. No
 large effusion, or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 1. Mildly enlarged heart and pulmonary vascular engorgement, unchanged.
 2. Rounded right basilar opacity may represent asymmetric edema, but other
 processes such as abscess cannot be excluded. At a minimum follow up with
 conventional PA/Lateral radiographs is recommended, ideally CT should be
 considered.
