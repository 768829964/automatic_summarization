 EXAM:  Chest, single AP semi-upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of shortness of breath

 FINDINGS:  Single AP semi-erect portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 Moderate-to-severe pulmonary edema is again seen.  Difficult to exclude
 underlying pleural effusions.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.  There has been interval placement of a large-bore left-sided
 catheter, distal tip not optimally seen, but likely terminates in the
 cavoatrial junction/right atrium.
