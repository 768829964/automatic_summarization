                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest, single AP supine portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall, on Coumadin, scalp hematoma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP supine portable view of the chest was obtained.  A large
 bore left-sided central venous catheter is seen extending to the right atrium.
 There is moderate pulmonary edema with possible trace bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Relative more confluent opacity in the right lung base is again
 seen, worrisome for consolidation which has been present over multiple prior
 radiographs and could relate to the pulmonary edema.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  Surgical clips seen in the upper abdomen.
