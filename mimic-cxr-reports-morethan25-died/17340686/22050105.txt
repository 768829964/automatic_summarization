 Left sided dual lumen catheter tip terminates within the proximal right
 atrium, unchanged.  Mild to moderate cardiomegaly is similar.  The aorta
 remains tortuous and diffusely calcified.  Mild pulmonary edema is unchanged
 compared to the prior study.  There is likely a small right pleural effusion,
 without evidence for pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Mild pulmonary edema, not significantly changed from the prior exam with trace
 right pleural effusion.
