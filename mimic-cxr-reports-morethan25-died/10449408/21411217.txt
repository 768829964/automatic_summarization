                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with cirrhosis and upper GI bleed, now status post
 massive resuscitation, increased oxygen requirement.  Evaluate pulmonary
 infiltrates.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi-erect chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Continued and unchanged bilateral pulmonary opacification consistent with
 pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar opacities may represent coinciding pneumonia in
 the proper clinical setting.  Small pleural effusions are again seen.  Right
 central venous line, gastric tube, and ET tube are unchanged and are in
 appropriate position. 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Unchanged pulmonary edema.  Basilar opacities may represent pneumonia in the
 proper clinical setting.
