                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  GI bleed with possible free air.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is no
 convincing evidence of free intraperitoneal gas.  However, the image is not
 definitely upright.  If there is serious clinical concern for free air, CT
 would be the next imaging procedure.  
 
 There are worsening bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with
 pulmonary edema.  The possibility of supervening pneumonia would have to be
 considered in the appropriate clinical setting.  Small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  
 
 Monitoring and support devices are essentially unchanged.
