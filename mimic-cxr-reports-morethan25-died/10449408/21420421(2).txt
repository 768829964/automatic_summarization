                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE SUPINE CHEST DATED ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are in standard position, and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Bilateral heterogeneous lung opacities
 involving the right lung to a greater degree than the left show interval
 slight improvement.  These findings are probably superimposed upon chronic
 lung disease.  Focal lucency in the region of the left lateral costophrenic
 sulcus raises the possibility of a small basilar pneumothorax, for which
 short-term followup radiographs are suggested.
