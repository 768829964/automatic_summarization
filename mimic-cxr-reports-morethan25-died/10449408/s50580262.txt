                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hepatitis C cirrhosis, GI bleed, respiratory
 failure.  Please evaluate for pneumonia, worsening pulmonary edema, ET tube
 position.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP semi upright chest radiograph was obtained.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Diffuse bilateral opacities are improved.  There is better aeration of the
 left lung.  However, there is increased opacification of the right base. 
 Prominence of the right hilum continues to be seen.  ET tube is elevated in
 the trachea and recommend advancement.  Gastric tube ends in the stomach and
 outside the view of the radiograph.  Right central venous line ends in the
 lower SVC.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Improved aeration of the left lung.  
 
 2. Mild improvement of the right lung opacity; however, there is increasing
 opacity of the right base.  This may represent redistribution of pulmonary
 edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or atelectasis and/or focal edema
 superimposed on background pneumonia, noting that many opacities appear
 asymmetric, focal and fairly unchanging.
 
 3. ET tube is approximately 9 cm above the carina.  Recommend advancement.
 
 4. Persistent bilateral hilar enlargement, although particularly prominent on
 the right; this is probably due to pulmonary congestion, lymphadenpathy or
 enlargement of pulmonary arteries, and a combination of these factors. 
 However, other etiologies such as a mass are not excluded, and if this
 appearance were to fail to resolve to baseline following acute illness, then
 chest CT might be appropriate in follow-up.
