                                 FINAL ADDENDUM
 ADDENDUM
 
 There is a subtle irregularity through the mid-to-distal left clavicle
 consistent with nondisplaced fracture.  The left acromioclavicular joint
 appears intact.

 ADDENDUM:
 
 In the setting of trauma, underlying contusion is not excluded.  No displaced
 fracture is seen.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Fall, question syncope.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained.  The cardiac
 silhouette is moderately enlarged.  Perihilar opacities suggest mild pulmonary
 edema.  However, there are additional patchy opacities in the right
 mid-to-lower lung which could relate to fluid overload, aspiration, or
 infection.  No evidence of pleural effusion is seen on the left.  There is
 persistent blunting of the right costophrenic angle, similar to prior.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Moderate-to-severe cardiac silhouette enlargement.
 2.  Perihilar opacity may be due to mild pulmonary edema.  However, additional
 patchy opacities in the right mid-to-lower lung could be due to prominent
 vasculature, infection, or aspiration.
