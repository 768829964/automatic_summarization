                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PA and lateral views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 10:54.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 The heart remains moderate to severely enlarged.  Mediastinal contours are
 stable.  Mild pulmonary edema appears similar compared to the prior exam. 
 More focal opacification in the right upper lobe may reflect asymmetric
 pulmonary edema, though infection cannot be completely excluded.  Atelectatic
 changes are also seen in both lung bases.  Small bilateral pleural effusions
 are noted.  There is no pneumothorax. Left mid clavicular fracture is again
 seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Persistent mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar atelectasis.  More focal opacity
 in the right upper lobe may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema though
 infection cannot be excluded.
