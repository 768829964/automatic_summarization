                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Diastolic congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, TBM,
 presents with dyspnea and fever.  Assess for interval change in edema and
 underlying consolidation.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable chest radiograph demonstrates a slight interval
 decrease of persistent enlargement of the cardiomediastinal silhouette.  There
 is also persistent though decreased bilateral pulmonary opacifications.  The
 remaining opacifications are predominantly within the right lower and left
 upper lungs.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Possible small left pleural
 effusion present.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Decreased evidence of pulmonary edema, though there is persistent
 multifocal opacifications, which may represent asymetric resolving edema
 versus infectious process.  Small left pleural effusion.
