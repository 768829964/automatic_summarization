                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory distress, evaluate for pneumonia or CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal portable radiographs of the chest demonstrate stable severe
 cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are stable.  There is new
 compared to the prior study there is new pulmonary edema with more confluent
 opacities in the left upper lung and right lower lung which could be
 asymmetric edema but multifocal infectious process is possible.  No large
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Stable severe cardiomegaly with new pulmonary edema.  More confluent opacities
 in the left upper lung and right lower lung could represent asymmetric
 pulmonary edema; however, infectious process is possible
