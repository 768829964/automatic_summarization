 FINDINGS:  Again the tracheostomy tube appears to project over the midline. 
 There is stable extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the lateral chest wall,
 pectoralis muscles and cervical regions bilaterally.  Diffuse unchanged
 reticulonodular interstitial process with a more focal airspace confluent
 opacity at the right apex appears stable compared to the prior exam.  There
 has been slight interval improvement in the previously noted pneumothorax. 
 There are stable small bilateral pleural effusions.  There is stable
 pneumoperitoneum.
