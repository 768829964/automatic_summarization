                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Endotracheal tube placement.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Endotracheal tube tip terminates approximately 4.5 cm from the carina.  The
 heart is mildly enlarged.  Calcification of the aortic knob is present.  Lungs
 appear hyperinflated, suggestive of underlying COPD.  Increased interstitial
 markings with indistinctness of the pulmonary vasculature suggests mild
 pulmonary edema.  Dense opacity within the retrocardiac region may reflect
 infection or aspiration, with atelectasis also in the differential.  Scattered
 ill-defined nodular opacities within the right mid lung field are also noted. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are present, small to moderate in size on the left
 and trace on the right.  No pneumothorax is identified.  The hila are mildly
 prominent.  Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the imaged spine with
 osteophytic spurring.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Chain sutures are seen
 projecting over the left lung apex.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Endotracheal tube tip is in standard position.
 
 2. Dense retrocardiac opacity could reflect pneumonia or aspiration with
 atelectasis also in the differential diagnosis.  Small to moderate left
 pleural effusion, and trace right pleural effusion.
 
 3. Increased interstitial opacities with indistinctness of the pulmonary
 vascular markings suggestive of mild pulmonary edema.
 
 4. Ill-defined nodular opacities within the right mid lung could reflect
 additional sites of infection.
