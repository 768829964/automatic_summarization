                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Tracheal injury.  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiograph from ___ at 13:59.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable AP chest radiograph.  
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 As compared to prior chest radiograph from earlier today, there is persistent
 pneumomediastinum and extensive subcutaneous emphysema of the chest wall with
 air dissecting along the pectoralis muscles and cervical regions bilaterally. 
 An endotracheal tube terminates 4.1 cm above the carina, and its cuff remains
 overdistended. The previously noted small right pneumothorax is not well seen
 on the current exam. Probable small bilateral pleural effusions. Lungs are
 hyperexpanded and there are diffuse areas of course interstitial and
 ill-defined nodular opacities bilaterally, with bronchiectasis and bronchial
 wall thickening which likely relate to chronic lung disease. Cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: Extensive subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. Previously
 noted small right pneumothorax is not well seen. Chronic interstitial lung
 disease with bronchiectasis and ill-defined nodular opacities suggestive of
 airways inflammation or infection. Small bilateral pleural effusions.
