  Little change in comparison to the prior study with minimal indisctiness of
  the pulmonary vasculature suggesting minimal pulmonary edema. Again noted are
  bilateral opacities, greatest at the left base, which raise suspicion for a
  multifocal infectious process, perhaps similar to the process seen on recent
  Chest CT from ___.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are in standard position.
 Cardiomediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Heterogeneous opacities
 in the left lower lobe have slightly progressed, and widespread poorly defined
 nodular opacities also appear slightly more conspicuous.  The patient has a
 known underlying MAC infection with bronchiectasis and centrilobular nodules
 on prior chest CT of ___.  The worsening multifocal opacities as
 compared to that time could reflect the clinically suspected diagnosis of
 aspiration pneumonia superimposed upon chronic changes related to atypical
 mycobacterial infection.  Chronic volume loss and bronchiectasis in right
 middle lobe and lingula appear grossly unchanged.
