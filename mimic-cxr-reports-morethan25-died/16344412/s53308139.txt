  1. Slightly increased density of a peripherally-based right middle zone
  opacity may represent a new consolidation versus atelectasis.
  2. Unchanged hyperinflation and coarse reticular opacities denoting chronic
  interstitial disease.
  3. Unchanged severe right middle lobe atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal lateral chest radiographs.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs available from ___ from ___ and chest CT from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 Chronic severe right middle lobe atelectasis is again seen.  The lungs remain
 hyperinflated.  Widespread coarse reticular opacities reflect chronic
 interstitial disease.  A small peripheral right middle zone opacity appears
 slightly denser, which may reflect atelectasis or new small consolidation. 
 Trace bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax. 
 The heart size remains normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1. Slightly increased density of a peripherally-based right middle zone
 opacity may represent a new consolidation versus atelectasis.
 2. Unchanged hyperinflation and coarse reticular opacities denoting chronic
 interstitial disease.
 3. Unchanged severe right middle lobe atelectasis.
