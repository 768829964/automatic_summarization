                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of tracheal laceration.  Please assess for position of
 the trach.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs dating back to ___, most recently
 ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP portable exam of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The tracheostomy tube position cannot be confirmed on this exam. 
 Again seen is extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the lateral chest wall,
 pectoralis muscles and cervical regions bilaterally, overall slightly improved
 compared to the prior exam.  There is mild pneumomediastinum, overall improved
 compared to the prior exam.  Underlying coarse interstitial pulmonary markings
 are again noted.  There appears to be bilateral unchanged diffuse
 reticulonodular interstitial process with a more focal airspace confluent
 opacity at the right apex.  The lungs remain hyperinflated.  The cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are otherwise stable.  Chain sutures at the left apex are
 again noted. Again noted is pneumomediastinum.  The right basilar pneumothorax
 appears to have improved compared to the prior exam.  There are probable small
 bilateral pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Tracheostomy position cannot be confirmed on this single-view study. Slight
 interval improvement in the pneumothorax compared to the prior exam.
