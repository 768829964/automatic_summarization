                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST SINGLE VIEW:  ___.
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with COPD and shortness of breath.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest was compared to prior chest x-ray
 from ___ and CT chest from ___.
 
 Again seen is prominence of the interstitial markings consistent with chronic
 lung disease with most significant opacification in the right perihilar region
 similar to prior CT.  There are, however, new areas of consolidation in the
 lungs bilaterally, particularly at the lateral aspect of the right mid lung
 and at the bilateral bases.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged as
 are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Evidence of chronic lung disease bilaterally, with additional
 areas of consolidation which are new since ___ and could represent
 active inflammation/infection.
