                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with mechanical ventilation requirement.  //
 ?PNA, pulmonary edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 13 26
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 3.9 cm above the carina. An NG tube
 is present. The tip is difficult to trace, but it appears to extend beneath
 the diaphragm, beyond the inferior edge of the film. Allowing for considerable
 rotation due to scoliosis, the right PICC line tip overlies the distal SVC
 near the SVC/ RA junction.
 
 There is possible minimal upper zone redistribution, but no overt CHF. There
 is patchy increased retrocardiac density, slightly improved compared with 1
 day earlier. Otherwise, no focal infiltrate. No gross effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Continued left retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse
 and/or consolidation, slightly improved compared with 1 day earlier. Possible
 minimal upper zone redistribution. Lines and tubes as described.
