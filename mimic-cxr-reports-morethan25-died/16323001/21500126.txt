 As compared to the previous radiograph, the tip of the nasogastric tube is now
 visualized.  It projects over the right sacroiliac joint, a position that is
 certainly in part caused by the massive scoliosis of the patient.  There is no
 evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax. Borderline size of the
 cardiac silhouette.  No pulmonary edema.
