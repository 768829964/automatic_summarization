                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single supine portable radiograph of chest was reviewed in
 comparison with prior chest exams through ___ to ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4 cm above the carina
 and is adequately placed.  Orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into
 the stomach and is appropriate.  Right subclavian line ends at upper
 SVC/cavoatrial junction. lung volumes remain low which decreases the
 sensitivity for assessment of mild pulmonary edema.  There are no interval
 changes in the chest.  Mild bibasal atelectasis is unchanged.  Small left
 pleural effusion is stable.  Cardiomediastinal contour has a similar
 appearance.  Heart size is unchanged.
