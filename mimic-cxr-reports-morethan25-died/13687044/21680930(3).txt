 it was in adequate position.  Right moderate pleural effusion is unchanged. 
 There is no pneumothorax.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Tube and lines are in adequate position except for distal end of NG tube
 which cannot be seen.
 2.  Unchanged right moderate pleural effusion.
 3.  Stable generalized increased bone density for which the differential
 diagnostic was already given.
