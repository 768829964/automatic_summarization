                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___:
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from earlier today.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage status post PICC line, assess
 PICC position.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable supine AP view of the chest was provided.  There is a
 small right pneumothorax, which is slightly more conspicuous compared with
 prior exam.  There is no evidence of tension.  This finding was discussed with
 Dr. ___ at approximately 11:15 a.m. on date of exam.  There is an
 unchanged right pleural effusion which is overall small to moderate in size. 
 Diffuse ground-glass opacity within the right lung is compatible with known
 alveolar hemorrhage.  There is left lower lobe atelectasis.  The heart is top
 normal in size.  The left PICC line has been retracted with its tip now well
 situated at the level of the upper SVC.  A right IJ central venous catheter
 tip is seen in the mid SVC.  The endotracheal tube tip appears low in the
 trachea with its tip at the level of the carina.  Retraction is advised by at
 least 2 cm.  The enterostomy tube is not well visualized due to
 underpenetrated technique.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Small right pneumothorax, slightly increased from prior exam.  Followup
 advised.  Findings discussed with Dr. ___ in MICU at the time of
 this dictation.
 2.  Low-lying endotracheal tube with its tip at the level of the carina. 
 Retraction by at least 2 cm is advised.  This recommendation was made with Dr.
 ___ at the time of this dictation.
 3.  Improved position of left PICC line with its tip residing in the upper
 SVC.
