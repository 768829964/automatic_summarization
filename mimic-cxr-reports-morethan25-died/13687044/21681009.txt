                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:05 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with respiratory failure and a chest tube on the
 right.  Evaluate interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 No right pleural effusion or pneumothorax, pigtail pleural catheter still
 present at the lateral aspect of the base of the right hemithorax.  Previous
 left lower lobe consolidation has improved.  The overall pattern looks more
 like mild pulmonary edema.  Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic.  ET tube in
 standard position.  Right jugular line ends in the upper SVC.  An upper
 enteric tube can be traced as far as the mid esophagus, but I do not see the
 tip and it may not extend into the stomach.  Clinical correlation advised. 
 Left PIC line ends in the upper SVC.  No pneumothorax or appreciable pleural
 effusion.
