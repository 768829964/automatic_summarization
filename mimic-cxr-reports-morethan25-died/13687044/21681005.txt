                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with shock, intubated and sedated, check
 endotracheal tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SEMI-ERECT:
 
 The patient is significantly rotated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube lies
 4.5 cm from the carinal angle and remains in satisfactory position.  The
 position of the tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter is also unchanged as is that of
 the right IJ line.
 
 Opacification of the left base is again noted, probably unchanged.
 
 A pigtail catheter is present at the right base, unchanged in position since
 the previous chest.  No pneumothorax is identified on this side.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No change since prior chest x-ray.
