                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Indwelling support and monitoring devices are unchanged in
 position.  Right pigtail pleural catheter remains in place in the lower right
 hemithorax with a probable small right pleural effusion.  Unusually sharp
 appearance of right hemidiaphragm is unchanged, and may reflect a basilar
 pneumothorax.  Within the left lung, an area of consolidation in the left lung
 base has slightly worsened, with new partial obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm.  This finding probably represents an area of infectious
 pneumonia given clinical history of this diagnosis.
