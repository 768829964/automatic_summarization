                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with CHF and dyspnea.  Evaluate for CHF.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal upright view of the chest was obtained portably.  Low
 lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  Increased perihilar opacity
 with pulmonary vascular engorgement in the setting of cardiac enlargement is
 likely due to mild congestive heart failure.  There is no substantial pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.  Increased opacity at the left lung base may
 represent asymmetric edema, but supervening infection cannot be excluded. 
 Degenerative change at the acromioclavicular joint on the left is noted with
 joint space narrowing.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Findings compatible with mild congestive heart failure. Recommend
 followup after treatment to evaluate for underlying infection.
