                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Leukocytosis.  Evaluate for interval changes in chest x-ray given
 recent pneumonia course.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___, ___, ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Upright AP and lateral radiographs of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lateral radiograph is suboptimal, severely limited by motion
 artifact and obscured by the arms. The patient is slightly rotated to the
 right, somewhat limiting the evaluation.  The lung volumes are slightly low,
 similar to the prior study.  There is new atelectasis at the right base.  The
 heart is top normal.  Allowing for rotation, the mediastinal and hilar
 contours are likely normal.  There is no large pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax.  The aorta and main thoracic vessels are heavily calcified. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes and new atelectasis at the right base.  No
 evidence of pneumonia.
