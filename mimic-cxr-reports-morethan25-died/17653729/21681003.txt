 WET READ: ___ ___:___ PM
  Endotracheal tube terminates at the carinal, and possibly proximal right
  mainstem bronchus, and must be pulled back. There has been no significant
  interval change in the atelectatic right lung, and small bilateral pleural
  effusions. No pneumothorax. Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___
  ___ by phone at 6:___p on the day of the exam, 5-minutes after discovery.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Worsening respiratory status; evaluate for collapse, pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 Rotated positioning.  An ET tube is present, the tip lies only approximately
 4.4 mm, immediately above the carina and retraction should be considered. 
 This is in keeping with the wet reading issued by radiology res9ident Dr.
 ___, detailed above. An NG tube is present, tip extending beneath
 diaphragm off film.  A right-sided PIC line overlies the proximal most SVC.  
 
 There is a moderate-sized right effusion, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  There is partial opacification of the lower half of the right
 hemithorax, which may reflect a moderate-sized effusion with underlying
 collapse and/or consolidation.  Faint opacity at the left base is most
 suggestive of a layering effusion.  There is upper zone redistribution and
 diffuse vascular plethora.  Scattered vascular calcifications are noted.  
 
 Compared with the radiograph from ___ at 5:___ a.m., the degree of
 opacification at the right base has improved slightly.
