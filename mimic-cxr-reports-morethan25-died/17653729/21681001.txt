                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post bronchoscopy for mucus plugging of the right mainstem
 bronchus, now with stable respiratory status.  Evaluate right lung
 atelectasis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ and ___, chest CT ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright bedside frontal chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 A right PICC courses into the upper SVC.  An enteric tube terminates in the
 stomach.
 
 
 There has been further reduction in the volume of bilateral pleural effusions,
 now small. Increased opacity at the right lung base is likely in part
 atelectasis, but early consolidation cannot be excluded.  There is no
 pneumothorax or focal airspace consolidation worrisome for pneumonia.  No
 pulmonary edema.  Cardiac silhouette is normal size. Mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Decreasing bilateral pleural effusions, now small.
 
 Continued density in the right base partially improved
