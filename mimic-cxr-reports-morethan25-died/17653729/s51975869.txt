                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 5:22 a.m.
 
 An ET tube is present, the tip lies approximately 5.6 cm above the carina.  An
 NG tube is present, tip extending beneath diaphragm overlying the fundus. 
 Sideport lies in the region of the GE junction, possibly immediately distal to
 it.  The right IJ central line is present, tip over distal SVC.  A right
 subclavian central line is present, the tip is obscured, but is probably
 unchanged, overlying the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Compared with the earlier film, CHF with interstitial edema remains present. 
 Hazy opacity at the lung bases is consistent with layering effusions, larger
 on the right, and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Enlarged
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is also again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  CHF, bilateral effusions, underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation, similar to the prior film.
