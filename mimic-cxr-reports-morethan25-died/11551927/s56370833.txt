 volumes and larger pleural effusions, mild pulmoary edema is difficult to
 exclude. The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.  The
 endotracheal tube ends 2.2 cm from the carina.  The right-sided internal
 jugular central venous line ends in the right atrium. No pneumothorax.  A
 nasogastric tube courses into the stomach and of the field of view.
