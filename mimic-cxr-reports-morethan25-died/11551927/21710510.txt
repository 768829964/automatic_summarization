                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man, newly intubated // assess ETT placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-upright AP chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 ET tube terminates 4.1 cm from the Carina.  The cuff is slightly hyper
 inflated. Right IJ terminates in the upper right atrium. Enteric tube courses
 below the left hemidiaphragm and beyond the field of view.  Lung volumes are
 very low.  There is worsening atelectasis at the right base. Worsening opacity
 at the left base likely reflects layering pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. ET tube terminates 4.1 cm from the Carina.  The ET tube cuff may be
 slightly hyperinflated.
 2. Lung volumes are lower and there may be minimal worsening of layering left
 pleural effusion.
