                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with acute panc  // interval progression     
 interval progression
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study ___ ___, the monitoring and support devices
 are unchanged. There are slightly better lung volumes. The hazy opacification
 at the bases has decreased and the hemidiaphragms are more sharply seen. This
 is consistent with decreasing pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis,
 though some of this may be due to a more erect position of the patient.
