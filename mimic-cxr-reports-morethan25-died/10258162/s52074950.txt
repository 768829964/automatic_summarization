                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Wheezing, status post extubation, rule out pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube has been
 removed.  As a consequence, the lung volumes have minimally decreased. 
 Otherwise, however, pre-existing parenchymal changes and the pleural effusion
 as well as the retrocardiac atelectasis are still present.  The size of the
 cardiac silhouette is constant.
