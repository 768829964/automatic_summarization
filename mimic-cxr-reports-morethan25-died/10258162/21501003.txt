                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with hypoxia.  Rule out effusion, pneumonia, or
 pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior studies, most recent of ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable view of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A complete displaced fracture of the right humeral head appears to
 be even more displaced today.  
 
 Bilateral pulmonary opacities, worse on the right, could be a combination of
 edema and have some component of more focal consolidations worrisome for
 pneumonia.  This is also an opacity in the retrocardiac area.  Support devices
 are in unchanged and correct position.
