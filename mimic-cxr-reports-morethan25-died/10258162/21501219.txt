                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Fever, assess for infiltrate.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___.  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A tracheostomy tube is appropriately positioned along the midline. 
 Dense retrocardiac opacification is not significantly changed, consistent with
 partial left lower lobe collapse.  A probable small left pleural effusion is
 not significantly changed.  The right lung is clear.  There is no right
 pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Aortic calcifications are noted. 
 A right-sided rib deformity is unchanged.  An old fracture of the proximal
 right humerus is redemonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant change in partial left lower lobe collapse or
 probable small left pleural effusion.
