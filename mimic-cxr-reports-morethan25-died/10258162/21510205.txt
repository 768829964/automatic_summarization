                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Pneumonia, fevers and vomiting.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 decreased.  There is a new left pleural effusion with left basal atelectasis. 
 In addition, on the right, there is a parenchymal opacity, likely atelectatic
 in origin, but the presence of pneumonia caused by aspiration cannot be
 excluded.  Short-term followup with chest radiography is required.
 
 Unchanged tracheostomy tube position.  Unchanged known right humeral fracture.
