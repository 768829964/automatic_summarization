                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Followup of the patient with pneumonia.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The ET tube tip is 4 cm above the carina.  NG tube tip is in the stomach.  The
 right internal jugular line tip is in the right atrium and might potentially
 be pulled back approximately 3.2 cm as suggested on the prior examination. 
 Again redemonstrated is right shoulder fracture.  Overall, there is slight
 interval increase in left pleural effusion that potentially may be positional
 and minimal increase in the interstitial edema.
