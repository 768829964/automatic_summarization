  1. Interim placement of dobhof with weighted tip in the expected region of the
  stomach.
  2. Interim placement of right possibly dialysis catheter with tip likely at
  cavoatrial ___. Again noted is right internal jugular line. Right IJ tip approx
  2.5 cm below the cavoatrial ___.
  3. Interim removal of left IJ line.
  4. Stable to improved  pul edema and bilateral pleural effusions.
  5. Again noted right humeral neck fracture.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 placement of a Dobbhoff tube that extends to the upper stomach.  Right
 dialysis catheter tip is at the level of the cavoatrial junction.  The right
 IJ line again extends to the lower portion of the SVC.  Left IJ catheter has
 been removed.
 
 Bilateral pleural effusions with compressive basilar atelectasis again seen,
 as well as continued elevation of pulmonary venous pressure.
 
 Right humeral neck fracture is again noted.
