                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST, ___, 23:28.
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Evaluate pneumothorax and degree of pneumomediastinum. 
 Chest tube placed to suction.
 
 Comparison is made to the patient's previous study at ___ at 20:48.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film ___ at 23:28 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  There continues to be extensive subcutaneous emphysema in the neck and
 pneumomediastinum.  Increasing pneumoperitoneum, which is concerning.  Dr.
 ___ was notified of this finding on ___ by phone at 12:05 p.m. and
 stated that the patient has subsequently undergone exploratory surgery.  There
 is a right chest tube in place.  A right internal jugular catheter and
 dual-lumen catheter remain unchanged in position.  Endotracheal tube has its
 tip at the thoracic inlet and the nasogastric tube is coursing below the
 diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach and the sideport near the
 gastroesophageal junction, unchanged.  Lungs are grossly clear.  There is
 likely a small right apical pneumothorax.  Overall, cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely unchanged given marked patient rotation on the current
 examination.
