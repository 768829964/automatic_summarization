                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Right chest tube with right collapse status post bronchoscopy, to
 assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there has been
 substantial re-expansion of the right lung with chest tube in place.  The
 mediastinal contours are in the midline.  Some residual atelectatic changes
 seen at the left base and there is hazy opacification in the right hemithorax
 consistent with effusion.  Subcutaneous gas is seen along the right lateral
 chest wall and right neck.
