                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Respiratory failure, pneumothorax, extubated.
 
 Portable AP chest radiograph was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 The right chest tube and right internal jugular line appears to be unchanged,
 but there is interval development of right lower lobe opacity, most likely
 reflecting aspiration.  Atelectasis would be less likely.  The patient also is
 in slightly progressed pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.
