                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Respiratory failure, intubated. 
 
 Comparison is made with prior study ___.
 
 Cardiac size is normal.  Widened mediastinum has improved.  Right lower lobe
 opacity has increased consistent with increasing atelectasis.  Right apical
 chest tube and central lines are in unchanged standard position.  There is a
 faint opacity in the left upper lobe, likely atelectasis. ETT is high 7.2 cm
 above the carina.
