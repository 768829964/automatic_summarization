                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Multiorgan system failure, evaluation for pneumonia and line
 placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  All monitoring and support devices are constant, except for the
 endotracheal tube that has been minimally advanced and now projects
 approximately 2.7 cm above the carina.  
 
 No safe evidence of pneumothorax on the current image, but extensive soft
 tissue air collection in the left and right cervical regions is seen. 
 Slightly increasing areas of right basal atelectasis.  Unchanged size of the
 cardiac silhouette.
