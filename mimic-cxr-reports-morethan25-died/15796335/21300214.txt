                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Intubated, previous pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present, tip in satisfactory position approximately 4.6 cm above
 the carina.  Two orogastric-type tubes are present.  In both cases, the tip
 extends beneath the diaphragm, off the film.  A right IJ central line is
 present, the tip overlies the SVC/RA junction, possibly over the uppermost
 right atrium.  An additional dual-lumen line is present, tips overlying the
 distal SVC/RA junction in right atrium.
 
 There may be a very tiny pneumothorax at the right lung apex -- attention to
 this area on follow-up films is requested.  Subcutaneous emphysema in the
 right supraclavicular region is again noted.  Mild vascular prominence and
 scattered atelectasis is present.  No frank consolidation or effusion
 identified.
