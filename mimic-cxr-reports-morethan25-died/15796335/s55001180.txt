                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE AP CHEST FILM ___ at 20:48
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with hepatic necrosis, evidence of
 pneumomediastinum on the morning chest film, assess for progression.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 02:27.
 
 Portable semi-erect chest film, ___ at 20:48 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Right chest tube remains in place.  A right internal jugular central line
 and dual-lumen catheter remains unchanged in position.  Endotracheal tube has
 its tip the thoracic inlet and a nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the
 diaphragm with the tip projecting over the stomach and the sideport port near
 the gastroesophageal junction.  Interval progression of extensive subcutaneous
 emphysema as well as the pneumomediastinum, which is now slightly more
 evident.  Given the extensive subcutaneous emphysema, evaluation for a
 pneumothorax is somewhat challenging.  No large pneumothorax is seen. 
 However, there is now intraperitoneal free air beneath the right
 hemidiaphragm.  Overall, cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  The left lung
 appears grossly clear with no evidence of a pleural effusion.
 
 Results of this examination were conveyed to the resident caring for the
 patient, Dr. ___, on ___ at 12:05pm.
