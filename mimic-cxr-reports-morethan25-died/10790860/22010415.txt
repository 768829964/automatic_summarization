                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Status post thoracentesis.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 11:27 a.m.
 
 There is slightly less opacity in the left mid and lower zones and, ? at the
 right lower zone.  Some of this may be accounted for by technique.  No
 definite pneumothorax is detected.  Minimal curvilinear lucency at the left
 lung apex is equivocal for pneumothorax, but attention to this area on
 followup films is requested.  A catheter overlies the left lung base, new
 compared with the most recent prior chest x-ray.
