                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ARDS, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-rays dated ___.
 
 Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change.  Again seen are
 extensive pulmonary opacities, most pronounced at the bases, but also
 involving the left upper and mid and portions of the right mid zone.  The
 differential diagnosis is extensive and involves CHF with pulmonary edema,
 infectious infiltrates, and ARDS.  Clinical correlation is requested.  
 
 An ET tube is present, tip approximately 4.1 cm above the carina.  An NG tube
 is present, tip extending beneath the diaphragm, off the film.  A left-sided
 pacemaker is present, with lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle.  A
 left IJ central line is present -- the tip is obscured by the pacemaker leads,
 but probably lies in the left brachiocephalic vein, near, but proximal to, its
 junction with the SVC.  No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Extensive bilateral pulmonary opacities are essentially unchanged.  Please
 see comment above.
 
 2.  Left IJ catheter unchanged. It is thought to overlie the left
 brachiocephalic vein.
