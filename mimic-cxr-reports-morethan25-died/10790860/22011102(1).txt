                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with tachypnea, shortness of breath
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP upright view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided pacemaker device is noted with leads terminating in the right
 atrium and right ventricle, unchanged. Heart size has substantially decreased
 compared to the previous exam, and is now minimally enlarged with a left
 ventricular predominance.  Diffuse atherosclerotic calcifications are noted
 within the aorta. The mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.
 Previously noted pattern of pulmonary edema has completely resolved. There are
 minimal streaky opacities in the lung bases likely reflective of atelectasis.
 There may be trace bilateral pleural effusions. No pneumothorax is identified.
 No acute osseous abnormality is detected
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimal bibasilar streaky atelectasis and possible trace bilateral pleural
 effusions.  Resolution of previously noted pulmonary edema.
