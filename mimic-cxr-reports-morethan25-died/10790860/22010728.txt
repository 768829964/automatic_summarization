 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with CHF, PNA with worsening dyspnea  //
 ?Pulmonary Edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions have increased since ___, obscuring
 the lower lungs, but there is heterogeneous consolidation in both mid and
