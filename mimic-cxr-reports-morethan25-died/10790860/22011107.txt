                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multiple medical problems on mechanical
 ventillation  // Please assess for interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support devices as
 well as the pacemaker leads are in constant position. The lung volumes have
 decreased, leading to an increased density of the pre-existing right and left
 retrocardiac parenchymal opacities. Signs of mild fluid overload continue to
 be present. The right PICC line is also unchanged.
