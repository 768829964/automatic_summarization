 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with congestive heart
 failure and pneumonia, on continuous breathing support.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged.  Bilateral consolidations appear to
 be unchanged, but there is mild improvement of pulmonary edema superimposed on
 multifocal pneumonia.  Pacemaker leads are in unchanged position in the right
 atrium and right ventricle.  Bilateral pleural effusion is most likely
 present.  No evidence of pneumothorax is seen.
