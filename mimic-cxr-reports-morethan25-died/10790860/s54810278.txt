 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Support and monitoring devices are in standard position and
 cardiomediastinal contours are stable.  Bilateral heterogeneous pulmonary
 opacities have slightly worsened in the interval, with relative sparing of
 right upper lobe.  They continue to be worse in the left lung than the right
 lung, and are most severe in the left lower lobe.  Small-to-moderate left and
 small right pleural effusions are also demonstrated.
