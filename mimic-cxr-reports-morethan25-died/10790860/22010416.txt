                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Rule out pneumothorax.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 12:18 p.m.
 
 There is no definite pneumothorax.  No other evidence for pneumothorax is
 identified.  
 
 ET tube tip lies approximately 4.1 cm above the carina.  NG tube extends
 beneath the diaphragm off the film. Chest tube at the left lung base is again
 noted. A left pacemaker with lead tips over right atrium and right ventricle
 again noted.  
 
 Possible interval increase in the degree of retrocardiac opacity, with
 increased obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm -- this may reflect increased
 collapse and/or consolidation in the left base.  Otherwise, I doubt
 significant interval change.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  No definite pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Interval increase in retrocardiac opacity and obscuration of the left
 hemidiaphragm suggesting increased left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation.  
 
 3.  Otherwise, I doubt significant interval change.
