                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:
 Status post intubation. Evaluate endotracheal tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs dating back to ___, the
 most recent on ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates interval placement of
 an endotracheal tube, with the tip terminating 3.3 cm above the carina. 
 Apparent change in tracheal caliber at the thoracic inlet is seen on multiple
 prior images.  A dual lead left-sided pacer is unchanged in position, with the
 leads overlying the right atrium and ventricle.  A right-sided PICC is
 retracted compared to prior exam, with the tip now terminating in the mid SVC.
 
 Diffuse airspace opacities are redemonstrated, with increased opacity in the
 right upper lung and a new opacity in the left upper lateral lung.  This could
 represent multifocal pneumonia, or an infectious process superimposed on
 asymmetric pulmonary edema. In the appropriate clinical setting, the
 differential could include other causes of alveolar opacities. There are again
 probable bilateral layering pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval placement of an endotracheal tube, with the tip terminating 3.3 cm
 from the carina.
 2. New focal opacity in the left upper lateral lung and the right upper lung,
 consistent with progression of multifocal pneumonia or an infectious process
 superimposed on asymmetric pulmonary edema.
 3. Retraction of a right-sided PICC, with the tip now terminating in the mid
 SVC.
 4. Probable bilateral layering pleural effusions.
