                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Suspected aspiration with significant cough.
 
 AP and lateral upright chest radiographs were reviewed in comparison to
 ___.
 
 Heart size is top normal, stable.  Mediastinum is stable in appearance
 including slight narrowing of the mid portion of the trachea and might be
 related to prior intubations.  Lungs are overall clear with no interval
 development of focal consolidation to suggest aspiration or pneumonia.  What
 appears to be is a central venous line catheter or potentially hemodialysis
 catheter terminates in the expected location of the right atrium, unchanged
 since the prior study on both PA and lateral views.  No appreciable pleural
 effusion demonstrated.  Dense material is projecting over the expected
 location of the stomach.
