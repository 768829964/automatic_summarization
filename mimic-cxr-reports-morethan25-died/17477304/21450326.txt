                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History: ___M with left -sided weakness (?chronicity), cough, 
 altered mental status// evaluate for acute process
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright and lateral views of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Cardiac silhouette size is mildly enlarged.  There is perihilar haziness and
 vascular indistinctness compatible with mild pulmonary edema. New bilateral
 pleural effusions are small in size. Bibasilar airspace opacities may reflect
 atelectasis. Infection is not completely excluded. No pneumothorax is
 identified.  A rugger ___ appearance of the imaged thoracic spine is
 compatible with renal osteodystrophy.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild pulmonary edema with small bilateral pleural effusions. Bibasilar
 airspace opacities may reflect atelectasis although infection is not excluded
 in the correct clinical setting.
