                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with weakness.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISONS:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest.  Large-bore left subclavian
 catheter terminates in the right atrium.  Lung volumes are low.  Bibasilar
 reticular opacities are compatible with chronic interstitial lung disease. 
 The trachea has a narrowed transverse diameter, which can be seen with chronic
 lung disease.  No focal consolidation, substantial pleural effusion, or
 pneumothorax.  The heart is normal size.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unremarkable.  Several radiodense bodies overlying the abdomen may represent
 pill fragments or metallic foreign bodies.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Chronic bibasilar interstitial lung disease.  Radiodense bodies
 overlying the abdomen may represent pill fragments or metallic foreign bodies.
