 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Chronic aspiration, three days of cough, assessment of right
 lower lobe for aspiration pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has taken a
 substantially deeper breath in.  The lung parenchyma is now well expanded. 
 The pre-existing parenchymal opacity at the bases of the right lung is no
 longer visible.  Currently, the lung parenchyma shows normal structure and
 transparency.  There is no evidence of pneumonia.  Normal size of the cardiac
 silhouette.  Moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.
 
 Unchanged dense right upper mediastinum with deviation of the trachea,
 potentially caused by a retrosternal goiter.
