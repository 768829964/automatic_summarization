                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with end-stage renal
 disease, on hemodialysis.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Right internal jugular line tip is at the level of mid SVC.  The NG tube tip
 passes below the diaphragm, terminating in the stomach.  Heart size and
 mediastinum are unremarkable.  There is still present right lower lobe opacity
 reflecting slightly improved right lower lung atelectasis.  Attention to this
 area to exclude the possibility of developing infection is recommended.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  Small amount of pleural effusion cannot be excluded.
