                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 3:12 AM, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, previous right lung collapse.  Likely mucus plugging.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ 8:51 p.m.:
 
 Overall, the volume and aeration of the right lung have improved, but
 substantial right middle and lower lobe atelectasis remain.  There is an
 indeterminate volume of subpulmonic right pleural effusion.  Left lung is
 clear of any focal abnormality, but shows some vascular engorgement possibly
 redirection of blood flow from the non-aerated right lung.  Heart is
 mildly-to-moderately enlarged, chronic finding, but is returning to the
 midline.  Right jugular line ends in the SVC.  No pneumothorax.
