                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with urosepsis, central line placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  A single portable AP semi-upright view of the chest is obtained. 
 There is interval placement of a right internal jugular central venous
 catheter with tip near the confluence of the internal jugular and right
 subclavian veins.  Although the trachea appears narrower than before, a prior
 CT torso from ___ showed displacement of the right innominate vein from
 the trachea; therefore, the increased distance between the right IJ line and
 the trachea need not be due to a hematoma.  Lungs are clear. No effusion or
 pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Interval placement of a right internal jugular line with tip at the confluence
 of the IJ and subclavian veins.
