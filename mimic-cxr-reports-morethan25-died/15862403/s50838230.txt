                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with a history of pneumonia who presents for
 evaluation, worsening tachypnea and altered mental status.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___; ___;
 ___ and ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single AP frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is a tunneled dialysis catheter ending in the cavoatrial
 junction.  The tip of the right-sided PICC appears to be obscured by the
 overlying catheter.  The tracheostomy tube is in appropriate position.  In the
 setting of poor inspiratory effort, there does appear to be a slight interval
 increase in the right middle and lower lobe consolidations. No new focal
 opacities are seen.  The right-sided pleural effusion appears to be stable
 with a small residual effusion remaining.  There is no visible pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Slight interval worsening of the right lung pneumonia.
