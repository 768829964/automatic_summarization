                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  Unchanged size of the cardiac silhouette.  Unchanged
 increased radiodensity in the region of the right middle lobe that could, in
 the light of a positive clinical history, potentially reflect pneumonia.
 
 No pleural effusions.  No pulmonary edema.  No pneumothorax.
