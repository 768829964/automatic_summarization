 AP CHEST, 10:24 P.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with respiratory failure and suspected endocarditis.
 Evaluate septic emboli, pneumonia or pleural effusions.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to most recent prior chest radiograph, ___:
 
 Patient has had median sternotomy, and wires are undisturbed since ___. 
 Borderline cardiomegaly is also stable.  There is now pulmonary edema and
 small right pleural effusion.  There are no large lung nodules, but small
 septic emboli are not likely to be obvious given the limitations of
 radiographic technique in a setting of mild pulmonary edema.  ET tube is in
 standard position and an upper enteric tube passes into the stomach and out of
 view.  No pneumothorax.
