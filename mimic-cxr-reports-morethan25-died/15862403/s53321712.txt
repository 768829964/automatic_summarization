                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluation for interval change in a patient with pulmonary edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___,
 performed five hours prior.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP semi-upright view of the chest was reviewed.  Compared
 to the most recent study performed five hours prior, there is new bilateral
 increased heterogeneity of the lungs with diffuse tiny lucencies consistent
 with interstitial pulmonary emphysema caused by barotrauma.  The lines and
 tubes remain in proper position and the cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  The small left pleural effusion has possibly increased.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New interstitial pulmonary emphysema due to barotrauma.
 
 COMMENT:  Findings were telephoned to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at
 11:19 a.m., three minutes after the time of discovery.
