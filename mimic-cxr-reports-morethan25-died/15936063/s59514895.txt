                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M w/pancreatitis and respiratory distress  // Assess for
 interval worsening of effusions, worsening edema?      Assess for interval
 worsening of effusions, worsening edema?
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to ___ at 18 38
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Portable AP semi-erect chest film ___ at 07:18 is submitted
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Left subclavian PICC line has its tip in the proximal SVC near the confluence
 of veins.  The right pleural pigtail catheter is unchanged in position
 positioned within a loculated pleural effusion.  Small left effusion likely
 not significantly changed given differences in inspiration.  Patchy bibasilar
 opacities, right greater than left, may reflect atelectasis, although
 aspiration and pneumonia should also be considered.  No obvious pneumothorax. 
 Increasing prominence of the pulmonary vasculature and perihilar vessels
 suggests worsening interstitial edema.  Clinical correlation is advised. 
 Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position.
