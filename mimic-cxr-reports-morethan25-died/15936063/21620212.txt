                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 10:21 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with leukocytosis, tachypnea, question interval
 change.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 There has been no interval change at least to prior chest radiographs, which
 are similar in appearance to chest radiographs since at least ___. 
 Specifically, left lung base is elevated by chronic moderate left pleural
 effusion responsible for substantial left lower lobe atelectasis.  Less severe
 atelectasis at the right lung base recurs intermittently.  The heart is
 moderately enlarged.  Upper lungs are grossly clear.  Tracheostomy tube in
 standard position.  Trachea looks generally narrowed, which could be a
 function of bronchomalacia, a chronic finding in this patient.
