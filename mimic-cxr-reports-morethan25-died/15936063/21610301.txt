                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New onset tachypnea, respiratory distress.
 
 CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 Compared with ___ at 4:11 a.m., I doubt significant interval change.  A
 tracheostomy is in place, unchanged.  A right subclavian central line tip
 overlies the distal SVC, unchanged.  No pneumothorax is identified.
 
 Again seen is cardiomegaly; prominence of the pulmonary arteries with a
 tapered appearance, consistent with pulmonary hypertension;  upper zone
 redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring;  left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, probably with a small left effusion.  There is minimal patchy
 opacity at the right base, ? atelectasis.  Relative lucency to the right of
 the spine and lower pneumomediastinum is noted, question artifact due to
 overlap of pulmonary artery with right cardiac shadow.  In the appropriate
 clinical setting, this could represent a deep sulcus sign. However, no other
 evidence of pneumothorax is identified and the finding has been unchanged
 compared with multiple prior films including ___ at 4:20 a.m.
 
 IMPRESSION: No significsnt change compared with ___.
