                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man in persistent vegetative state s/p remote CVA,
 s/p PEG/trach on long-term mechanical ventilation now s/p CT-guided pleural
 catheter placement for right hydropneumothorax.  // Assess for worsening R
 hydropneumothorax, currently s/p CT-guided pleural catheter placement on low
 continuous wall suction.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___ at 10:13
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared to the prior study, there has been interval placement of right-sided
 catheter with partial interval decrease in the size of the
 loculatedpneumothorax at the right lung base.  The right hemidiaphragm remains
 somewhat depressed, but apparently much less so.  A small component of the
 pneumothorax is again seen in the right paratracheal region, also decreased in
 size.  A rind of increased density along the lower edge of the right lung is
 again noted, similar to the prior study-- question related to compressive
 atelectasis.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is near midline, with only
 minimal residual right ward shift.  Possible small amount of right pleural
 fluid.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unchanged in size in contour.  Linear
 lucency seen adjacent to the descending aorta is unchanged and likely
 represents artifact as there is no suggestion of pneumomediastinum in this
 area on the CT images from ___.
 
 Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion are also
 grossly unchanged.
 
 There is upper zone redistribution, but doubt overt CHF.
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Interval placement of tube at right lung base, with improvement of the
 right base and right medial apex pneumothorax.  The degree of tension and an
 depression of the right hemidiaphragm and right ward shift of the mediastinum
 appear improved.  (Please note that the initial wet read suggested that the
 right pneumothorax was unchanged.)
 2. Density at the right lung base likely reflects severe compressive
 atelectasis --___ to this area on followup films is requested.
 3. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and small left effusion,
 grossly unchanged.
 4. Cardiomegaly and mild vascular plethora, without overt CHF, similar to
 prior.
