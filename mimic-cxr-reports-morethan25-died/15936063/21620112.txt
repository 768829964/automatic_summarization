                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Increased blood pressure, questionable pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged evidence
 of moderate cardiomegaly, moderate left pleural effusion and left basal
 atelectasis.  In addition, vascular structures in the lungs have increased in
 diameter so that mild pulmonary edema is likely to be present.  The
 tracheostomy tube is in unchanged position.
