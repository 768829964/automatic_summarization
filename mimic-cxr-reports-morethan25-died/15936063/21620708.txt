                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with acute on chronic respiratory
 failure.  Not tolerating tracheal collar.  Evaluate etiology of worsening
 respiratory distress.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study ___ ___.  The patient has a tracheostomy
 cannula in place, the position of which appears unchanged.  Trachea appears
 unaltered and airways are seen including proximal portion of the main bronchi.
 There is no evidence of any pneumothorax.  There is no sign of significantly
 increased pulmonary vascular congestion.  The right hemithorax shows a
 normal-appearing lateral pleural sinus without evidence of pleural effusion. 
 Heart size cannot be evaluated in detail because overlying left lower thoracic
 densities most likely representing pleural effusion and portion of
 atelectasis.  These left-sided basal changes have not undergone any
 significant interval alteration that can be identified on these limited
 single-view chest examinations.
 
 Considering your diagnostic dilemma, a lateral chest view could be helpful to
 demonstrate possible pleural effusion accumulating in the posterior dependent
 pleural sinuses.  Although the left lung base densities may include
 inflammatory pneumonic changes that are not easily detected on a single-view
 examination.  If important for clinical management, consider performance of
 CT.
