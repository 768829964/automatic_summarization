                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Recent IVH and tachypnea.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.  
 
 Lordotic positioning.  A tracheostomy tube is in place.  A right subclavian
 central line is present, tip over mid SVC PICC line.  No pneumothorax
 detected.  
 
 Compared with ___, I doubt significant interval change. There is
 background hyperinflation.  Again seen is increased opacity at the left base,
 with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, consistent with left lower lobe
 collapse and/or consolidation.  An associated small left pleural effusion
 cannot be excluded.  There is asymmetric upper zone redistribution, more
 pronounced on the left, without overt CHF.  The extreme right costophrenic
 angle is excluded from the film.  Vertical linear opacity projecting over the
 left upper zone may represent a skin fold.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and suspected small
 left pleural effusion, stable compared with ___ at 3:23 a.m.
