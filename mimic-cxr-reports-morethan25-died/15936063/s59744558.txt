                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  Trach, on chronic ventilator use, increased oxygen requirement,
 question aspiration.
 
 Tracheostomy is again visualized.  The heart continues to be moderately
 enlarged.  There is a moderate left pleural effusion.  There is volume
 loss/effusion/infiltrate in the left lower lung.  There is a small right
 effusion.  Compared to the prior study, the fluid status appears slightly
 worse.  An underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be excluded, particularly
 on the left.
