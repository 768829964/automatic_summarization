                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Persistent vegetative state with tracheostomy and hypoxia.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study of ___.
 
 Large left pleural effusion has increased.  There is probably a small right
 pleural effusion.  Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  The right PICC
 tip is in the mid SVC.  There is no evident pneumothorax.  There are low lung
 volumes.  There is worsening left lower lobe opacity, likely atelectasis. 
 Vascular congestion is stable.
