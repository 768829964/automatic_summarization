                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with persistent vegetative state s/p CVA,
 chronically vent-dependent with recent development of right hydropneumothorax
 and trapped lung, complicated by superimposed staph empyema now s/p 3 weeks of
 antibiotics and drainage via pleural catheter.  Pleural catheter placed to
 water seal x 48hrs after diminishing suction output.  // Assess for
 reaccumulation/resolution of pleural effusion, pneumothorax - pleural catheter
 to water seal x 48hrs after two weeks of low-continuous wall suction. 
 Assessing candidacy for eventual removal of pleural catheter.
 
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 TECHNIQUE:   Chest radiograph, frontal view
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  Bibasilar atelectases are
 persistent.  Left pigtail pleural catheter and tracheostomy tube are in
 unchanged position.  Minimal loculated right basal pneumothorax is similar as
 before.  Heavy calcification of aorta is noted.  Cardiac silhouette is within
 normal size limits.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 No notable change.  Stable small bilateral pleural effusions.
