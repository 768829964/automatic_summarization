                                 FINAL REPORT
 AP CHEST, 12:26 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with increased respiratory rate.  Suspect infection.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Left hemidiaphragm is chronically elevated.  Irregular opacification at the
 base of the left lung is also longstanding finding.  In the left lung
 projecting over the third anterior rib is a region of irregular peribronchial
 infiltration.  This is the only finding to suggest active infection, a very
 small region indeed.  Healed rib fractures are present at multiple levels in
 the right hemithorax.  Mild cardiomegaly is chronic.  The patient has
 longstanding tracheostomy.  Fullness in the upper mediastinum is a function of
 mediastinal fat deposition and tortuous vessels and some enlarged lymph nodes
 as shown on the chest CT, ___, which also demonstrated severe upper
 tracheomalacia and chronic left lower lobe consolidation, presumably
 atelectasis.
