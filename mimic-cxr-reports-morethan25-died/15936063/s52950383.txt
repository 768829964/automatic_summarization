                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Respiratory failure.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is again increased
 opacification at the left base silhouetting the hemidiaphragm, consistent with
 the previous suggestion of chronic atelectasis and effusion.  Continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without vascular congestion.  This
 raises the possibility of cardiomyopathy or pericardial effusion.
 
 Tracheostomy tube is in place, and the right lung is essentially clear.
