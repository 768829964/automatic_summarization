                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Stroke, evaluation for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes and the
 size of the cardiac silhouette are unchanged.  Also unchanged is the position
 of the tracheostomy tube.  The opacities at the left lung base, likely
 combined to a small left pleural effusion, are constant in appearance and
 severity.  The opacities could reflect atelectasis, pneumonia or a combination
 of the two.  The right lung bases and the right lung in general continued to
 be unremarkable.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
