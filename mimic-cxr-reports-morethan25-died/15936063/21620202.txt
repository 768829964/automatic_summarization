                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Chronic tracheostomy, thicker secretions and more
 frequent suctioning required.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.  
 
 The tracheostomy is in place with its tip being approximately 8.3 cm above the
 carina.  There is interval increase in left pleural effusion as well as
 worsening of the right lower lobe atelectasis with potentially developing
 infectious process in both lung bases.  Upper lungs are essentially clear. 
 The left PICC line tip is not well seen, most likely terminating at the level
 of the left brachiocephalic vein.
