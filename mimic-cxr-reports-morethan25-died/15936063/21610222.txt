                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  ICH, on ventilator.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the monitoring and support
 devices remain in place.  There is continued opacification at the left base
 consistent with pleural effusion and underlying compressive atelectasis.  In
 the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia
 would have to be considered.
 
 No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion.
