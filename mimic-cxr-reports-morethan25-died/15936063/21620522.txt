 HISTORY:  Wheezes bilaterally.  Evaluate for infiltrate.  
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi upright portable chest radiograph.

 chest ___.
 
 FINDINGS: A tracheostomy tube is unchanged, within the midtrachea.  An enteric
 tube terminates within the duodenum.  A right upper extremity PICC is in the
 distal SVC/cavoatrial junction.  Retained enteric contrast is seen in the left
 upper quadrant appear 
 
 There has been an increase in mild pulmonary edema and prominence of the
 central vasculature.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are unchanged.  There
 is persistent elevation of the left hemi-diaphragm with overlying atelectasis.
 There is no pneumothorax.  The cardiac and mediastinal contours, including
 moderate cardiomegaly, are unchanged.
