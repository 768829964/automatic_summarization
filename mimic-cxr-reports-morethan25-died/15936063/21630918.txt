 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CVA with resultant minimally conscious state
 and chronic respiratory failure, s/p PEG/trach and  dependent on mechanical
 ventilation, now with tachypnea/tachycardia and transient hypoxemia.  //
 assess for etiology of acute respiratory decompensation including evidence of
 pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, pleural effusion, etc.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Small bilateral pleural effusion is slightly larger today than it was on
 ___. Moderate cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion are
 stable. There is probably no pulmonary edema.
 
 Aeration of the left lower lobe the base of the lung is less clear than it was
