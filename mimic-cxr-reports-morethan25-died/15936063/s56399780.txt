                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Increased secretions, on ventilator.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Tracheostomy tube remains in place.  Continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with left basilar opacification consistent with substantial
 effusion and volume loss at the left base.  The possibility of supervening
 pneumonia would have to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
