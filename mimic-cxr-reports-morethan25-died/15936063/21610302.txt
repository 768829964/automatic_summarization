                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  New short of breath, question interval change.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:
 
 Compared with ___ at 23:15 p.m. and allowing for technical differences, I
 doubt significant interval change.  Suspected bullous change at both lung
 apices.  Rounded lucency faintly seen in the left upper abdomen may represent
 a G-tube.
