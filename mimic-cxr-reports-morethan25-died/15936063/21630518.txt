  Small right lower lung consolidation could represent a small infectious focus,
  but differential diagnosis includes atelectasis; low lung volumes, patient
  positioning, and frontal view only limit this study. Slightly increased
  prominence of pulmonary vasculature with persistent left mid lung atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p CVA w prolonged hospital course now w AMS and
 fever  // PNA?
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to the previous radiograph, there is increase in diameter of the
 pulmonary vessels, potentially indicative of fluid overload.  The size of the
 cardiac silhouette continues to be enlarged. Areas of atelectasis are seen at
 both the left and the right lung bases.  No pneumothorax.  No pneumonia.
