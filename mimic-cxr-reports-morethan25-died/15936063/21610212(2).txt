                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Dobbhoff placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there has been placement of a
 Dobbhoff tube that lies within the upper stomach.  The opaque portion probably
 straddles the esophagogastric junction.  Increased opacification at the left
 base laterally is consistent with atelectasis and effusion.
