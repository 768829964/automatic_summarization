                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  History of tracheostomy and recurrent resistant pneumonia, now
 with oxygen desaturation and decreased breath sounds on physical exam, here to
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  A tracheostomy tube is in appropriate position.  In comparison to
 the most recent prior study, there is similar appearance of the opacified left
 lung base silhouetting the left heart border and left hemidiaphragm,
 compatible with chronic moderate left pleural effusion and associated left
 lower lobe atelectasis.  Superimposed infection in the appropriate clinical
 context cannot be excluded.  Mild streaky opacification of the right lung base
 is compatible with atelectasis.  The cardiac silhouette is incompletely
 evaluated, but remains moderately enlarged.  The upper lung zones are
 relatively clear.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent left basilar opacification, likely a combination of
 moderate left pleural fluid and underlying atelectasis or consolidation.
