                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male with dementia and new onset delirium, now
 desaturating on room air with right basilar crackles.
 
 COMPARISON:  AP upright and lateral chest radiographs ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP chest radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  The patient's neck is flexed and the head obscures the left apical
 region.  There is slightly reduced lung volumes as compared to prior.  There
 is stable cardiomegaly with left ventricular prominence.  There has been
 increase in the left retrocardiac opacity most likely representing pleural
 effusion; however, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia
 must be considered as well.  There is no evidence of vascular congestion or
 pulmonary edema.  The right hilum appears fuller than it had on the prior;
 however, direct comparison cannot be made given the differences in technique. 
 Pleural surfaces are unremarkable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increasing left lower lung field opacity most likely representing
 pleural effusion; however, in the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed
 pneumonia must be considered.
