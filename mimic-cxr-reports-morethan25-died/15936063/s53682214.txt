 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with prominent vegetative state, history of
 pneumonia, now with hypoxic respiratory distress and worsening confusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph, ___.
 
 PORTABLE AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Borderline cardiomegaly is again noted. 
 Opacification at the left lung base consistent with pleural effusion and
 adjacent compressive atelectasis appears improved since most recent prior
 examination of ___.  Underlying infectious process cannot be
 completely excluded in the correct clinical setting.  Minimal opacification in
 right lung base may represent atelectasis.  The right PICC tip projects over
 the expected region of the mid SVC.  The tracheostomy tube appears slightly
 angulated with respect to the trachea and needs to be repositioned.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tracheostomy tube is malaligned with respect to the trachea, position
 needs to be reevaluated.  Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 14:21 on
 ___ via telephone.
 2.  Retrocardiac opacification may represent pleural effusion with adjacent
 compressive atelectasis; however, underlying infection cannot be completely
 excluded in the correct clinical setting.  These findings are improved since
 most recent prior examination.
