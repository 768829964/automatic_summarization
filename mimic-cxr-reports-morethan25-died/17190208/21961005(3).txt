                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with a history of ACoM aneurysm s/p coiling and VP shunt
 placement, acute on chronic SDH, atrial fibrillation with RVR presented after
 a syncopal event on ___. His hospitalization has been complicated by
 cellulitis associated with PIV, atrial fibrillation with RVR, increasing
 lethary and obtundation and fevers to 104.8 without clear etiology.  // eval
 for Dobhoff placement - will need XR   tech for ___ min  eval for Dobhoff
 placement - will need XR   tech for ___ min
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 15:09.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New Dobhoff feeding tube, with the wire stylet in place is sharply folded and
 projects over the upper midline chest.  I suspect it is in the mid esophagus,
 rather than the airway because it extends just lateral to the contour of the
 tracheal bronchial tree.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly and moderate right basal atelectasis are unchanged since
 earlier in the day.  Large granulomatous calcifications are present in the
 lower mediastinum and left hilus.
 
 Small left pleural effusion is likely.  No evidence of pneumothorax.
