                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man recently extubated who had been having increased
 secretions but has been improving.  Poor cough.  // interval change/pneumonia?
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Since a recent study of 1 day earlier, bibasilar opacities have worsened, and
 are probably secondary to atelectasis although differential diagnosis includes
 aspiration and developing infectious pneumonia.  Small pleural effusions are
 also demonstrated, but there is no visible pneumothorax.
