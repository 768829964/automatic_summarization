                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable chest radiographs
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with worsening respiratory failure  // interval
 change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable chest radiograph dated ___ at 09:05
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 In comparison to the chest radiograph obtained 3 hours prior, there are new
 opacities projecting over the left lung and silhouetting the left heart
 border, likely atelectasis of the lingula with associated leftward mediastinal
 shift and elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  The right lung is fully
 expanded and clear.  No pleural effusions.  No pneumothorax.  An ETT, right IJ
 central venous catheter, left IJ central venous catheter, enteric tube, and VP
 shunt appear unchanged and appropriately positioned.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New, left lung atelectasis and lingular consolidation suggest recent
 aspiration or new airway obstruction.
