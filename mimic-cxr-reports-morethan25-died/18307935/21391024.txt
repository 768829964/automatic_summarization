 or pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal contours are normal.  Epicardiac device
 leads are in unchanged position.  There are no enlarging pleural effusions. 
 Faint opacities in the right mild lung could be due to atelectasis, but
 aspiration can also be present.  There are minimal atelectases in the left mid
 lung.
