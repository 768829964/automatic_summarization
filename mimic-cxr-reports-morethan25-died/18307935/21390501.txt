                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Sepsis, respiratory failure.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study, ___.
 
 There are persistent low lung volumes.  Cardiomediastinal contours are
 unchanged.  Multifocal lung opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally, are
 greater on the left;  and in the upper lobes, greater on the right. These
 opacities have minimally increased in the left upper lobe.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  ET tube is in standard position.  NG tube tip is high as
 before, in the proximal aspect of the stomach and can be advanced for more
 standard position.
