                                 FINAL REPORT
 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, ___
 
 HISTORY:  Epicardial ICD device removed and leads extracted.  Evaluate
 position of the severed lead ends.
 
 IMPRESSION:  PA and lateral chest compared to ___:
 
 As far as one can tell on two orthogonal conventional radiographs, all of the
 leads have been retracted intrathoracically.  CT scanning would be definitive.
 There has been no change at all in the relative orientation of the surface and
 implanted epicardial stimulator leads.  Three incised electrode ends are
 clustered superiorly, probably in the anterior costal pleural space.  The
 fourth lead is curled inferiorly, and probably terminates close to the
 pericardial surface of the cardiac apex.  The texture of the lungs suggest
 bullous lung disease, although lung volumes are small.  There is no
 pneumothorax or evidence of fluid in either the pleural space or pericardium.
