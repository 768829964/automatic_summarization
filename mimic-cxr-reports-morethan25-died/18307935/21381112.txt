                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Persistent fever after surgery.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is persistent elevation
 of the left hemidiaphragm without acute vascular congestion or pleural
 effusion.  There is an area of increased opacification in the left perihilar
 region.  In view of the clinical symptoms, this could conceivably represent a
 developing consolidation.  There is also a small area of opacification in the
 right mid lung laterally that could be a consolidative focus.
 
 Little change in the position of the tip of the central catheter, which
 extends to lower portion of the SVC.  Slight bending of the PICC catheter that
 could be merely positional.
