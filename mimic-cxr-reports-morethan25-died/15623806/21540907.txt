 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Flash pulmonary edema, reintubation.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  Minimal fluid overload, but no overt pulmonary edema at the current
 time point.  The presence of a mild left pleural effusion cannot be excluded. 
 Retrocardiac atelectasis that is constant.  No pneumonia.  Moderate
