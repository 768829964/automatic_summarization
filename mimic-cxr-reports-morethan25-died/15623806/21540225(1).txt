                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Flash pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 7 hours earlier.
 
 Mild to moderate cardiomegaly has minimally increased in size.  This could be
 due to technique, but attention on followup studies is recommended to exclude
 the presence of pericardial effusion.  Mild pulmonary edema has minimally
 increased.  Bilateral opacities are a combination of atelectasis and a small
 bilateral pleural effusion; superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
