                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube placement and monitor for effusions and
 pneumonia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was read in comparison with
 multiple prior radiographs with the most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Endotracheal tube tip is approximately 5 cm above the carina and is
 adequately positioned.  Orogastric tube courses below the diaphragm; however,
 its distal end is off the radiographic view.  An ill-defined opacity in the
 right mid lung unchanged since at least ___ is concerning for
 pneumonia.  Right lower lung opacity is persisting.  Previously, this opacity
 worsened between ___ and ___, but over last 24 hours, it has
 decreased and the residual opacity is concerning for right lower lobe
 pneumonia.  Increased retrocardiac density on the left side either represents
 atelectasis and/or consolidation, concurrently associated infection cannot be
 reliably ruled out on a single frontal view.  Left upper lung is clear. 
 Pleural effusions if any are small bilaterally.
