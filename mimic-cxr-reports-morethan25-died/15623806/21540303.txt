 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man with ventilator-associated pneumonia.  Check ET tube
 placement and progression of pneumonia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Greater opacification in the right mid and lower lung zones could be due to
 progressive consolidation in the right lower lobe, but is more likely due to
 increased right pleural effusion.  Although heart is normal size, vascular
 congestion suggests mild cardiac decompensation.  Opacification in the left
 lower lobe has been present since at least ___, without appreciable change. 
 No pneumothorax.  ET tube in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube passes
 below the diaphragm and out of view.  No pneumothorax.
