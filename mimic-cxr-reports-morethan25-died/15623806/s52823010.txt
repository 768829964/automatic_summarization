                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tip of endotracheal tube terminates approximately 4.5 cm above the
 carina, and a nasogastric tube terminates below the diaphragm.  Cardiac
 silhouette is mildly enlarged and accompanied by new pulmonary vascular
 congestion and bilateral perihilar haziness suggestive of edema.  More
 confluent areas of opacity in the right upper and right lower lobes could
 potentially represent an evolving pneumonia, particularly given findings
 concerning for right upper lobe pneumonia on recent CT of one day earlier. 
 Small pleural effusions are present, right greater than left.
