                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP upright chest view was read in comparison with prior chest
 radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Over the last 24 hours, mild to moderately severe asymmetric pulmonary edema,
 predominantly involving the mid and lower lungs and right side more than left,
 has improved with predominant improvement appreciated on the left side. 
 Residual opacities could be unresolved pulmonary edema; however, if any of
 this represents infection, cannot be determined based on radiograph alone and
 needs to be reviewed in conjunction with clinical history. Increased
 retrocardiac density may reflect atelectasis and/or consolidation and is
 similar. Mild to moderately enlarged heart size and probable small bilateral
 pleural effusions are unchanged.  There is no pneumothorax.  Mediastinal and
 hilar contours are unremarkable.  Minimal calcification in the aortic arch is
 unchanged.
