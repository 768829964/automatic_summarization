                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with ventilator-associated pneumonia and
 non-ST elevation myocardial event, tubes and lines, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest
 examination obtained with patient in semi-erect position and dated ___.  Cardiac enlargement as before.  The pulmonary congestive pattern has
 further increased.  We have now perivascular haze throughout the entire
 pulmonary circulation.  Diffuse hazy densities on the bases obliterate the
 visibility of the diaphragmatic contours and are indicative of bilateral
 pleural effusion.  When comparison is made with the next preceding
 examination, the congestive pattern has further increased.  No pneumothorax is
 identified.  The patient is intubated, the ETT terminates in the trachea some
 5 cm above the level of the carina.
