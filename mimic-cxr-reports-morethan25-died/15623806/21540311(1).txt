                                 FINAL REPORT
 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Tachypnea.  Follow up pulmonary edema.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed 9 hours earlier.
 
 Moderate pulmonary edema has worsened.  Mild cardiomegaly is unchanged. 
 Bibasilar opacities, larger on the right side are grossly unchanged.  These
 could be due to atelectasis, but superimposed infection cannot be excluded.
 
 Right upper lobe opacity is unchanged, also worrisome for a focus of
 infection.  Small-to-moderate right pleural effusion is unchanged, allowing
 for the difference in positioning of the patient.
