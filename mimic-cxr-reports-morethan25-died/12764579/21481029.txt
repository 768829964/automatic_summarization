                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Acute hypotension, evaluation for acute process.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices, including the three right-sided chest tubes after decortication are
 in constant position.  The right postoperative lung opacities and the right
 pleural effusion as well as the post-surgical rib fractures are constant.  In
 the left lung, there is increasing retrocardiac atelectasis and, potentially,
 a developing small left pleural effusion.  No pneumothorax.
