                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with status post motor vehicle collision and in
 respiratory failure.  Right-sided chest tube.  Look for interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single portable chest view was reviewed in comparison with prior
 chest radiographs through ___ with the most recent from ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Endotracheal tube ends approximately 3.3 cm above the carina and
 is appropriate.  Right internal jugular line terminates at upper SVC and right
 subclavian line ends at cavoatrial junction/upper right atrium. Orogastric
 tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach; however, the distal end is
 off the radiographic view. Since last 24 hours, there is no significant
 interval changes in the chest.  Chest tubes on the right side terminating near
 the right hilus are unchanged in position.  Right lower lung opacity secondary
 to loculated effusion and atelectasis and bilateral pulmonary congestion is
 similar in appearance.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  No
 demonstrable pneumothorax.
