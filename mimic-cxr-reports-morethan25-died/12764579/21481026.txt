                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY, ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Right chest tube remains in place with persistent moderate to large
 loculated right pleural effusion, but no visible pneumothorax. 
 Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Mild pulmonary vascular
 congestion is present.  Improving aeration at both lung bases likely due to
 improving atelectasis.
