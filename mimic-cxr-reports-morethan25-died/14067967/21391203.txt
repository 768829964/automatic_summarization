                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PA AND LAT)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M with chest pain, crackles in left lower lung, no cough, no
 fever
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Left-sided AICD device is noted with leads terminating in unchanged positions
 in the right atrium and right ventricle.  Mild enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.  Aortic knob calcifications are present.  The
 mediastinal and hilar contours are similar.  Mild interstitial pulmonary edema
 is demonstrated with a probable trace left pleural effusion, although the
 posterior costophrenic angles are excluded on the lateral view.  No
 pneumothorax is present.  Patchy atelectasis is again seen in the lung bases. 
 Moderate multilevel degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema with probable small left pleural effusion. 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities, likely atelectasis.
