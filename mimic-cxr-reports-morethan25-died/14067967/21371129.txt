                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Hypoxia, question pneumonia.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 7:39 a.m.
 
 Compared to the prior film, I doubt significant interval change. 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar.  The left-sided pacemaker and
 vascular lines are unchanged.  Minimal atelectasis at both lung bases is
 similar.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle may be slightly improved. 
 The left costophrenic angle is excluded from the film.  No overt CHF is
 detected.  No focal consolidation in the upper and mid zones away from the
 areas of atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No definite interval change.
