 WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 11:55 AM
  
  
  
  A right PICC is identified, its tip obscured by the overlying pacer
  defibrillator. A courses in and uncomplicated course and at least is
  identified within the mid SVC. Low lung volumes results in bronchovascular
  crowding. Probable left pleural effusion is seen. Bilateral basilar
  atelectasis is noted.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)CHEST (PORTABLE AP)i
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with sCHF, renal failure s/p PICC placement in
 ___  // confirm PICC line placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs since ___ most recently ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 A right PIC line passes at least as far as the upper SVC but the tip is
 obscured by indwelling pacer defibrillator leads, ending in the right atrium
 and along the floor of the right ventricle, as before.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly has increased since ___, partially a function of
 the lower lung volumes, but there is increased pulmonary vascular congestion
 suggesting borderline cardiac decompensation. Pleural effusions are small if
 any.  No pneumothorax. .
