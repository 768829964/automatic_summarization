 TECHNIQUE:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are unchanged in appearance.  In the absence of
 lateral view the amount of pleural effusion on the low left in particular is
 difficult to compare but most likely is unchanged since the prior study. The
 right PICC line tip is at the level of superior SVC. No new consolidations
 demonstrated. No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 There is no evidence of pulmonary edema, in fact there is even minimal
 improvement of the vascular enlargement as compared to previous study
