                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with previous VT s/p ablation and in respiratory
 failure likely secondary to PNA  // compare to prior     compare to prior
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison to prior study dated ___ at 07:50
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Dual lead left-sided pacemaker, right subclavian PICC line and endotracheal
 tube are unchanged in position.  Heart remains stably enlarged. Mediastinal
 contours are stable.  Probable small layering left effusion with persistent
 retrocardiac opacity which could reflect compressive atelectasis, although
 aspiration or pneumonia could have this appearance. Clinical correlation is
 advised. No large pneumothorax is appreciated. No evidence of pulmonary edema.
