                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with alveolar hemorrhage  // Evaluate for
 interval change
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 As compared to previous radiograph of 1 day earlier, cardiomediastinal
 contours are stable and support and monitoring devices are similar in
 position.  Widespread asymmetrically distributed airspace opacities have
 slightly worsened in the lower lungs, and bilateral layering pleural effusions
 also appear slightly increased although positional differences limit
 COMPARISON.
