                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hypoxia  // ARDS?
 
 COMPARISON:
 Chest x-ray from ___ at 03:47
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lines and tubes are similar to the prior film. Compared to the prior film,
 diffuse bilateral interstitial and alveolar opacities are new or much more
 pronounced, slightly more pronounced on the right. The right minor fissure is
 slightly thickened and slightly retracted. There is increased retrocardiac
 density, with interval obscuration of the medial left hemidiaphragm. No gross
 effusions.
 
 
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 
 1. Increased interstitial and alveolar infiltrates seen diffusely throughout
 both lungs. The most likely differential is CHF. Infection or ARDS might also
 account for this appearance, but CHF is more likely to develop this rapidly.
 2. Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation
