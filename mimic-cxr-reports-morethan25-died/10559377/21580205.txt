                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  No focal consolidation, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. As
 before, the left hilus has a somewhat lobulated contour. Consider non urgent
 chest CT for evaluation of this area when clinically appropriate. ___M with CVL
 and sepsis  // Eval for CVL placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  PORTABLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A right-sided central venous catheter via a right internal jugular approach
 terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction.
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits. The heart
 is normal in size.  The lungs are somewhat low volume.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion identified. Subtle opacities seen in the
 bilateral lung bases could represent atelectasis, aspiration or possible
 atypical, predominately interstitial infection.  There is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Patchy bibasilar opacities could represent atelectasis, aspiration or
 infection. pulmonary vascular congestion with mild interstitial edema.
