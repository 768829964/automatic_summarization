                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with complicated hospital course, now s/p trach
 with ?VAP, repeat CXR while on trach mask  // eval for pna, pulm edema    
 eval for pna, pulm edema
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___ at 03:50.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Previous improvement seen earlier today in bilateral severe perihilar
 pulmonary consolidation, has reversed. It could be due in part to changes in
 positive under pressure ventilation support and/or fluid volume, since there
 was an accompanying transient decrease in cardiac size, particularly right
 atrium.
 
 Mild small to moderate right and small left pleural effusion are unchanged. No
 pneumothorax. Tracheostomy tube midline. Left PIC line ends in the mid SVC. No
 pneumothorax.  PEG tube ends in distended stomach.
