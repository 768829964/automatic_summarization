                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HIV, group C strep bacteremia, VAP on last
 day of abx, now with fever.  // evaluate infiltrates, volume status
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior radiographs most recent on ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy and left-sided PICC are stable in position.
 
 Widespread alveolar opacities have increased from ___ are less
 significant in extent compared to ___.  This likely reflects a
 combination of increasing edema and persistent multifocal infection.  No
 pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. The cardiomediastinal and
 hilar contours are within normal limits.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Widespread alveolar opacities are increased from the most recent prior exam
 consistent with increasing edema in the setting of persistent multifocal
 infection.
