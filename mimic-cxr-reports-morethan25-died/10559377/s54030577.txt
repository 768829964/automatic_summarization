                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Evaluate for interval change in a patient with increasing
 respiratory distress and tracheostomy.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___, ___, ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A portable semi supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrates a tracheostomy
 terminating in the mid thoracic trachea.  Bilateral opacities are increased. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are increased, with the increase more significant
 on the left than right.  There is no pneumothorax.  The visualized upper
 abdomen is unremarkable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Increased bilateral opacities, possibly representing increased pulmonary
 edema.  Multifocal pneumonia, ARDS, or hemorrhage is also a possibility.
 2. Increased bilateral pleural effusions.
