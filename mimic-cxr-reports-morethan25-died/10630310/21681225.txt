 INDICATION:  History of mild chronic seizures, intubated and sedated in a
 medication-induced coma with acute desaturation event, currently mechanically
 ventilated.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Right internal jugular central line terminates at the mid SVC.  Endotracheal
 tube is in appropriate position in the mid trachea.  A gastrostomy tube is
 present within the stomach.  There is new opacification of the right lower
 lobe with obscuration of the right hemidiaphragm which may represent
 atelectasis or aspiration. There is no pneumothorax.  A right pleural effusion
