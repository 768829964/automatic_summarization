                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with multiple seizures, evaluate for
 pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 similar study dated ___.  On the single AP frontal view, there is
 no evidence of any pneumonic infiltrates.  Heart size is unchanged and within
 normal limits.  No pneumothorax in the apical area.  A previously described
 Dobbhoff line has been advanced further and one notices that the line makes a
 360-degree loop in the proximal esophagus at the level of the clavicles.  The
 Dobbhoff line itself has advanced further and its tip exceeds the lower limit
 of the present image.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of pneumonia.  Adjustment of the unusual loop of the
 NG tube is recommended as it may give discomfort to the patient.  Referring
 physician, ___, was paged.
