                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with HTN, CAD, shortness of breath  // acute
 shortness of breath
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison to ___ radiograph, cardiomegaly is now accompanied by
 pulmonary vascular congestion and interstitial edema.  More confluent
 opacities in the lower lobes, right greater than left, may reflect
 asymmetrical distribution of pulmonary edema or a secondary process such as
 aspiration or evolving infectious pneumonia.  Small pleural effusions are also
 evident.
