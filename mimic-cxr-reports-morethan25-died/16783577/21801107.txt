  Diffuse bilateral airspace consolidations in the setting of recent
  cardiopulmonary arrest likely correspond to diffuse pulmonary edema. 
  Endotracheal tube terminates in the mid thoracic trachea.  Enteric tube
  terminates in the left upper quadrant.  Right internal jugular central venous
  line terminates in the upper right atrium.  There is no evidence of
  pneumothorax.  Heart size is top-normal.

 please evaluate for acute intrathoracic abnormality      please evaluate for
 acute intrathoracic abnormality
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been dramatic increase in
 the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, consistent with severe
 pulmonary edema.
 Endotracheal tube is been placed with its tip approximately 5 cm above the
 carina.  Nasogastric tube extends to the mid to lower body of the stomach. 
 Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC.
