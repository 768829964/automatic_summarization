                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with pneumonia status post prolonged intubation. 
 Evaluate for pneumonia or pulmonary edema.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs, most recent from ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Right internal jugular catheter terminates in the upper SVC.  Endotracheal
 tube terminates 1.2 cm above the carina.  Recommend withdrawal of the
 endotracheal tube by several cm for more optimal positioning.  Nasogastric
 tube extends into the stomach.  The median sternotomy wires are intact.  There
 is stable, mild cardiomegaly.  Mediastinal and hilar contours are unchanged.
 Interval improvement in bibasilar opacities.  Apparent increased opacity
 projecting over the right apex is likely secondary to superimposed external
 structures.  Recommend more symmetric positioning with removal of external
 structures on subsequent radiographs.  No pneumothorax. Interval improvement
 in mild pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Interval improvement in mild pulmonary edema and bibasilar opacities.
 2. Endotracheal tube terminates 1.2 cm above the carina.  Recommend withdrawal
 by several cm for more optimal positioning.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed with the medical resident by ___
 ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 12:22 PM, 10 minutes after
 discovery of the findings.
