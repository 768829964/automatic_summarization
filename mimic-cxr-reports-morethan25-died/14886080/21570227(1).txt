 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis  //
 interval change
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  Study performed 6 hours earlier
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Now small left pleural effusion has markedly decreased.  opacities in the left

 infection cannot be excluded, attention in followup studies and correlation
 with clinical setting is recommended.  ET tube is in standard position.  There
 is no evident pneumothorax.  There are low lung volumes
