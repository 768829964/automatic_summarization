                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with multiple medical comorbidities with recent
 CXR notable for stable PTX, improving apical consolidation, and stable left
 pleural effusion.  // Please evaluate for progression of pleural effusion vs.
 worsening consolidation vs edema.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Compared with ___ at 09:20, the overall appearance is similar. 
 The patchy focal opacity at the right lung base may be very slightly more
 confluent and dense, but this may also be accounted for by differences in
 positioning.
 
 Small left effusion and left base atelectasis is again noted.   
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette and mild upper zone redistribution is probably
 unchanged.
 
 Oro gastric type tube and left subclavian PICC line again noted.  No definite
 pneumothorax, though due to rotated positioning, a tiny pneumothorax in the
 right upper zone might not be apparent.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Right upper zone opacity again seen, question slightly more confluent and
 denser.  There remains possible that this is an artifact of positioning. 
 Continued close attention to this area is recommended.
