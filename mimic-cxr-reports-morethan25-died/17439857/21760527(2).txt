                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  CHEST, AP PORTABLE SINGLE VIEW.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with aspiration history, left base
 rales, low-grade fever, evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study of ___.  The on previous portable
 examination identified extensive parenchymal densities in the left-sided mid
 lung fields have regressed markedly.  There remain some peribronchial density
 in the lower lobe area, but no new abnormalities are seen.  Mild blunting of
 the left-sided lateral pleural sinus is noted.  In the right hemithorax,
 diffuse density in the lower area persists and conceals the diaphragmatic
 contour suggestive of larger right-sided pleural effusion.  Previously
 identified large size calcified granuloma persists and is unchanged.
 
 During the latest examination interval, the patient underwent a chest CT on
 ___.  This study confirmed the left-sided parenchymal densities
 as being related to aspirations.  Study also revealed extensive intracardiac
 valve calcifications, and recommended performance of an echocardiogram.
