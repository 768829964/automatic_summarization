                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST FROM ___ AT ___
 
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with chronic respiratory failure, now with
 fever, altered mental status, question pneumonia.
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at 5:22.
 
 Portable AP supine chest from ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Tracheostomy tube remains in satisfactory position.  There
 continues to be a layering right effusion and a smaller left effusion. 
 Overall, the bilateral air space opacities do not appear to be significantly
 changed and may represent a diffuse infectious process, pulmonary edema or
 pulmonary hemorrhage.  Clinical correlation is advised.  A calcified mass in
 the right upper peripheral lung corresponds to a partially calcified mass seen
 on CT dated ___ and therefore likely represents a granuloma.  Left
 subclavian PICC line is unchanged with its tip in the distal SVC.  Overall
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.
