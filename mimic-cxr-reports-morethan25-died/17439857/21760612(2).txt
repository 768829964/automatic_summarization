                                 FINAL REPORT
 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Acute respiratory distress.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed with comparison to ___.
 
 The AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates ET tube tip being approximately
 6.2 cm above the carina.  The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm,
 terminating in the stomach.  The extensive consolidations appear to be
 substantially progressed since the prior study, bilaterally involving
 predominantly perihilar areas and thus concerning for pulmonary edema. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions are present.  The right PICC line tip is at the
 level of mid-to-low SVC.
