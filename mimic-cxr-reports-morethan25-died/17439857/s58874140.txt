 Portable semi-erect chest from ___ at 4:54 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  There continue to be layering bilateral effusions with increasing
 consolidation, particularly at the left base which could reflect partial lower
 lobe atelectasis.  Overall, the bilateral air space process appears to have
 slightly worsened which could reflect worsening infection or pulmonary edema. 
 Clinical correlation is advised.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 stable.  No large pneumothorax.  Left subclavian PICC line and tracheostomy
 tube are unchanged.
