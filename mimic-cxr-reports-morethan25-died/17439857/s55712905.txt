                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  Pulmonary hemorrhage, dyspnea.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP semi-erect portable views of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Midline tracheostomy tube is again seen.  The previously seen right-sided PICC
 is no longer present.  Moderate right and a small left pleural effusions are
 grossly stable in position.  Rounded density measuring approximately 1.9 cm
 projecting over the lateral right upper lung is stable.  In the interval since
 the prior study, there has been significant interval increase in left
 perihilar opacity and is some right perihilar opacity to lesser extent.  Given
 history of pulmonary hemorrhage, findings could represent worsening
 hemorrhage, asymmetric pulmonary edema, infectious process not excluded.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax is seen.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Again seen bilateral pleural effusions.  
 
 In the interval since the prior study, there has been significant interval
 increase in left perihilar opacity and is some right perihilar opacity to
 lesser extent.  Given history of pulmonary hemorrhage, findings could
 represent worsening hemorrhage, asymmetric pulmonary edema, in the appropriate
 clinical setting, infectious process not excluded  No definite evidence of
 cavitation is seen, although this could be better evaluated for on CT.
