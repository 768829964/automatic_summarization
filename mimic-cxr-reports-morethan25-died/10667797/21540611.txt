                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lymphoma, pulmonary edema  // interval
 monitoring      interval monitoring
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, the right IJ catheter tip now
 appears to be at the level of the cavoatrial junction.  Other monitoring
 support devices are unchanged.
 There are improved lung volumes, though probably little overall change in the
 extensive areas of opacification bilaterally, most likely reflecting a
 combination of pulmonary lymphoma, infection, and edema.
