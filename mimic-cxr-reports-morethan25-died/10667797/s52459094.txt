  Portable upright chest radiograph demonstrates a chest tube which projects
  over the left hemithorax.  Lung volumes are low with scattered opacities
  bilaterally more conspicuous relative to prior examination, most consistent
  with post surgical changes.  There is no large pleural effusion to suggest
  hemothorax.  Heart borders are slightly obscured though the heart size is
  grossly similar.  Air within the subcutaneous tissues of the left chest wall
  is in keeping with postsurgical changes.  Imaged osseous structures and upper
  abdomen are unremarkable.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary nodules and dyspnea s/p left
 VATS wedge biopsies and pericardial window  // Rule-out pneumothorax,
 hemothorax     Rule-out pneumothorax, hemothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there has been a vats procedure
 performed with a left chest tube in place and no definite pneumothorax. 
 Subcutaneous gas is seen adjacent to the lower lateral chest wall.
 There is bilateral increase in opacification most likely representing
 pulmonary vascular congestion along with standard postsurgical changes at the
 left base.  In the appropriate clinical setting, superimposed pneumonia would
 be difficult to exclude.
