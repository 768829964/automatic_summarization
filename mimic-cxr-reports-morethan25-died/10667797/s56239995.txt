                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with pulmonary nodules and dyspnea s/p left
 VATS wedge biopsies and pericardial window  // Rule-out pneumothorax,
 hemothorax     Rule-out pneumothorax, hemothorax
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of ___, there again are postsurgical
 changes in the left hemithorax with chest tube in place.  The left apical
 region is difficult to assess, but no prominent pneumothorax is appreciated.
 Diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications are again seen.  Although most
 likely representing pulmonary vascular congestion, in the appropriate clinical
 setting it would be difficult to exclude a superimposed pneumonia, especially
 in the absence of a lateral view.
