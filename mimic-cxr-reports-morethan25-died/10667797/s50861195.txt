                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old woman with lymphoma and worsening respiratory status 
 // New/worsening infiltrates
 
 COMPARISON:  CHEST X-RAY FROM ___ AT 13:48.  TARGETED REVIEW OF
 CHEST CT FROM ___
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 
 Again seen is diffuse bilateral airspace disease, there assessed on the
 dedicated chest CT obtained less than an hour previous.  The radiographic
 appearance is overall similar a subtle there is of increased opacity at the
 right base appear to be present.  No gross effusion identified.
 
 
 The endotracheal tube terminates 2.4 cm above the level of the carina.  A
 right internal jugular central venous line overlies the upper right atrium. 
 No pneumothorax is detected.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Diffuse bilateral airspace disease, similar to earlier the same day, though
 some interval increase in the opacity at the right base laterally appears to
 be present.  As suggested on the recently obtained chest CT, this appears to
 represent an combination of background pulmonary nodules with new superimposed
 parenchymal opacities, raising the question of multifocal pneumonia or diffuse
 aspiration.  In the appropriate clinical setting, hemorrhage might also
 account for this appearance.  The CT also suggested an element of pulmonary
 edema.
 
 Lines and tubes as described.  The right IJ central line tip overlies the
 upper right atrium.  If clinically indicated, this could be retracted by
 approximately 1.5 cm.
 
 No pneumothorax detected.
