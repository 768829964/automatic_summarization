                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man intubated, diuresing for heart failure  // please
 assess for change in pulmonary edema
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent from ___. 
 Chest CT ___, ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are stable with moderate to severe
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette in widening of the mediastinum.
 Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes are stable in appearance.  Known calcified
 pericardium is not well visualized on the current study appear There is a
 small to moderate right pleural effusion and a small left pleural effusion,
 not significantly changed.  Lung volumes are low, and diffuse airspace
 opacities are not slightly improved at the lung bases.  These may represent
 combination edema, but superimposed infection is not excluded.  ETT and right
 internal jugular line are in unchanged, standard positions.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Mild improvement in mulifocal airspace opacities since the most recent prior
 study, which may reflect improvement in pulmonary edema.
