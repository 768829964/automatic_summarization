                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man s/p pericardectomy  // eval effusion
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The patient has been extubated, and a new tracheostomy tube has in place. A
 left basilar pigtail catheter, Swan-Ganz catheter, nasogastric tube, right
 basilar chest tube, and left IJ central venous line are unchanged. Sternotomy
