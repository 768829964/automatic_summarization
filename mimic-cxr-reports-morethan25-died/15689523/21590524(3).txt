                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with respiratory failure s/p intubation  // ett
 placement      ett placement
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pulmonary edema developed between ___ and ___.  There was clear mild
 pulmonary edema in the upper lungs on ___ accompanied by increased
 moderate bilateral pleural effusions.  The lung bases however were severely
 and heterogeneously consolidated, a finding that suggests concurrent
 pneumonia.  The new endotracheal tube is in standard placement and improved
 lung volumes may explain the apparent decrease in bibasilar consolidation. 
 Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is chronic.
