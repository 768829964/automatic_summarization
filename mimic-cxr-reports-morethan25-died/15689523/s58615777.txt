                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with constrictive pericarditis, hx TB.  AM sputum
 with small amount blood  // Evaluate for abnormalities
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  None available
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with enlargement of the bilateral
 hila and widening of the upper mediastinum likely related to lymphadenopathy
 some of which appears calcified.  Thickening of the pleural space on the right
 could represent a partially loculated effusion and/or pleural thickening.
 There is some degree of volume loss in the right lung. An interstitial process
 in the right lower lobe could reflect asymmetric edema with pulmonary vascular
 congestion noted elsewhere.  There is a small left pleural effusion. No
 pneumothorax. Calcification is noted along the pericardium consistent with
 history of constrictive pericarditis.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Moderate right partially loculated effusion and/or pleural thickening. 
 Given unknown chronicity of this finding,a CT is recommended to further
 evaluate.
 
 2.  Interstitial process in the right lower lung likely reflects asymmetric
 edema but CT may also be helpful to better characterize this process.
 
 3.  Calcified right mediastinal nodes and calcified granuloma, consistent with
 prior granulomatous exposure.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on
 the telephone on ___ at 12:55 PM, 5 minutes after discovery of the
 findings.
