                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pleural effusion  // eval
 
 TECHNIQUE:  AP and lateral view of the chest
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The tracheostomy tube is no longer visualized.  Diffuse bilateral interstitial
 opacities with perihilar predominance have increased as compared to the prior
 examination.  There is also increased airspace consolidation in the lower
 lobes.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are stable.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged including engorgement of the azygos and central venous
 structures.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1. Diffusely increased bilateral opacities with a perihilar predominance is
 consistent with worsening moderate pulmonary edema.
 
 2.  Small bilateral pleural effusions are overall unchanged.
