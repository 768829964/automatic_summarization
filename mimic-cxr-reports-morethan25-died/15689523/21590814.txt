                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  Portable AP chest radiograph
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with shock of unknown etiology and respiratory
 failure  // ET tube/line placement
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest portable AP
 
 COMPARISON:  Portable AP chest radiograph dated ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Since the chest radiograph obtained 2 days prior, multifocal parenchymal
 opacities have increased in extent and severity, most notably at the right
 lung base and mid left lung, which may reflect mildly increased pulmonary
 edema. A tracheostomy tube terminates approximately 6 cm above the carina with
 an overinflated cuff.  A right-sided IJ tunneled catheter terminates in the
 right atrium approximately 2 cm inferior to the superior cavoatrial junction. 
 A left-sided IJ central venous catheter terminates in the upper SVC at its
 junction with the left brachiocephalic vein.  Calcified mediastinal lymph
 nodes are unchanged.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Interval worsening of multifocal parenchymal opacities likely reflect mildly
 worse pulmonary edema.  Tracheostomy cuff appears overinflated.
 
 NOTIFICATION:   The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr.
 ___ on the telephone on ___ at 11:36 AM, approximately 45 minutes
 after discovery of the findings.
