 IMPRESSION: 
 
 ET tube is now in standard position.  The Swan-Ganz catheter describes a
 smaller arc through the right heart but still ends in the right pulmonary
 artery.
 Right paramedian drainage catheter traverses the right chest, is unchanged in
 position but I cannot localize it anatomically on a single frontal view. 
 Feeding tube passes into the stomach and out of view.
 Moderate bilateral pleural effusions are still present.  Moderate to severe
 pulmonary edema, worse in the right lung, and enlargement of the
 cardiomediastinal silhouette are unchanged.
