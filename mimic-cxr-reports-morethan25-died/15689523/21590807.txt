                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ M h/o chronic respiratory failure s/p tracheostomy, chronic

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs ___ through ___.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Relatively symmetric improvement in opacification of the upper lungs suggests
 a component of resolving edema.  Most of the residual abnormality is probably
 pneumonia.  Small right pleural effusion is unchanged since at least ___.  Moderate cardiomegaly is chronic.  No pneumothorax.
 
 Left jugular line ends the origin of the SVC.  Right jugular hemodialysis
