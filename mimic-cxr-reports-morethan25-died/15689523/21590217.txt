                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with pericardiectomy  // r/o inf, eff
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The contour abnormality in the left mediastinum obscuring the main pulmonary
 artery and descending thoracic aorta is again noted but slightly less
 prominent.  As previously stated this could reflect a mediastinal fluid
 collection or pseudoaneurysm. There is mild pulmonary edema decreased compared
 to prior study and a similar right parenchymal opacity.  The right internal
 jugular sheath is unchanged.  There are bibasilar chest tubes. No pneumothorax
 is noted.  Again noted is a right calcified hilar lymph node.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Slightly less conspicuous contour abnormality of the left mediastinum to which
 continued attention followup should be paid.
