                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:   CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man with hx of TB, treated for pneumonia, chronic
 pleural effusion and pulmonary edema with SOB, evaluate for interval changes.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest PA and lateral
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated ___.
 Chest CT dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 The right chest tube is unchanged as compared to prior chest CT, with
 side-port within the right lower thoracic cage.  Median sternotomy wires are
 intact.  Tracheostomy tube is unchanged in position, terminating 5 cm above
 the carina.  A small to moderate sized right pleural effusion is again noted. 
 Peribronchial cuffing and diffuse airspace opacities are consistent with
 persistent pulmonary edema.  A calcified right hilar lymph node is again
 noted.  The mediastinal silhouette is stable.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Persistent pulmonary edema with patchy airspace opacities, superimposed
 infection cannot be excluded.
