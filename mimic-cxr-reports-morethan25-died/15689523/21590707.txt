                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___ year old man on trach for respiratory failure, being treated
 for stenotrophomonas infection and fluid overload, with acute worsening of
 respiratory distress  // interval change
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray ___ at 20:10
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 A tracheostomy tube is in place.  The right IJ central line is again noted,
 with tip overlying the proximal SVC.  Previously seen left IJ line has been
 removed.  Better seen on today's exam is tubing or catheter overlying the
 right lung base extending along the right side of the mediastinum.  No
 pneumothorax detected.
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette, with widened superior mediastinum, is grossly
 unchanged.  Calcified mediastinal lymph nodes again noted.
 
 Again seen is vascular plethora, and CHF, possibly slightly more pronounced. 
 There is increased opacity at both lung bases, with probable right and
 possible left effusion, also similar to the prior study.
 
 Balloon from GI tract tube noted in left upper quadrant.
 
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Overall, doubt significant interval change.  CHF findings may be slightly
 worse.  Bibasilar opacities are unchanged.
